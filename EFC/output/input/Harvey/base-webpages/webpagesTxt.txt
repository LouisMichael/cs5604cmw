Surfside Beach began to see high storm surge from Hurricane Harvey on Friday. (KTRK).  . . . . . . . KTRK. By. . . . . . .  . Kaitlin McCulley. Friday, August 25, 2017. SURFSIDE BEACH, Texas (KTRK) -- . As Hurricane Harvey approached Surfside Beach, residents heeded the mandatory evacuation warning, leaving the area noticeably empty as the storm surge began to rise on Friday.. Brazoria County Judge Matt Sebesta said residents need to watch the weather closely and evacuate if required or asked to do so..  .  . "Be prepared. We don't know what this thing is going to do," Sebesta said.. There are about 4,000 residents in the mandatory evacuation area.. Those who chose not to evacuate tried to stock up on necessities like water before Harvey's approach.. "Give us your best shot, buddy," quipped resident Robert Bradley as he showed off a room full of large water bottles and other necessities..  .  . "In the winter time, we have cold fronts come from the north that blow just as hard. Now we've got one coming from the south," Bradley added.. The Bradleys and others who chose to remain will be on their own should serious trouble arise. The sheriff and police chief both said they won't risk the lives of first responders to save people who didn't listen to evacuation warnings..

Although Harvey has weakened to a tropical storm since roaring ashore Friday night, meteorologists say the weather system's slow-moving nature will bring copious amounts of rain to southeast Texas in the coming days, which will lead to rising sea levels and flooding coastlines.. . . . . .

Below is a projected timeline of what to expect from Harvey over the next few days, according to forecasts from the National . Weather.  Service and ABC News meteorologists:. . . . Sunday. . . . Harvey weakened to a tropical storm by Saturday afternoon after making landfall as a Category 4 hurricane. The storm is expected to weaken further and slow down, as it meanders between Victoria and San Antonio.. . . As of around 4 a.m. local time Sunday, over the last 24 hours, the Houston and Galveston areas received 24.10 inches of measured rain, according to the National Weather Service.. . . Houston is expected to experience devastating flooding, as Harvey lingers over Southeast Texas.. . . . ABC News. Satellite and radar imagery of Hurricane Harvey shows the eye of the storm near Victoria, Texas, Aug. 26, 2017.. . . . . . . . . Sunday through Monday. . . . Harvey will head back toward the coastline and interact with the warm waters of the Gulf Coast early next week. Earlier forecast models indicated the storm could re-emerge briefly over the Gulf of Mexico and then make a second landfall in northeastern Texas or Louisiana. However, the latest track shows Harvey sticking to land, but coming close enough to the water to draw in some moisture, which will fuel additional rainfall.. . . This means areas that were already hit hard along the Texas coast should expect even more rain and wind, setting the stage for potentially catastrophic flooding and storm surge. Rainfall in some areas in Houston could reach as much as 40 to 50 inches.. . . "This is a very bad scenario to be dealing with," ABC News meteorologist Daniel Manzo said Saturday. "This will lead to staggering prolific amounts of rain.". . . . ABC News.

Harvey not gone – likely to strengthen again over Gulf, threaten Texas as a hurricane. . . .         . By  . Mark Sudduth.  . |.  .  . August 22, 2017.  .  - 10:17 AM.  . |.  .  .  . Atlantic Basin.  .  . . . . . Remember tropical storm Harvey? It made its way across the open Atlantic as a tropical wave and became a tropical storm just before reaching the Windward Islands a few days ago – bringing flooding rains to Barbados especially. Then, it died away, almost.. . . The low level energy associated with Harvey has remained very much intact and is now over the Yucatan peninsula, poised to emerge in to the Bay of Campeche later tonight. From there, computer models strongly suggest that it will strengthen and perhaps to hurricane intensity. This is concerning since it will be doing so while moving towards land, possibly Texas and/or northeast Mexico. The time frame from it becoming a depression again to hurricane strength may be short and people along the coast may not realize what’s coming.. . . I have produced a video discussion covering this topic plus a look at 92L (which is not likely to do very much in the coming days). Check out the video below and note that I will have another one posted early this afternoon:. . . . . M. Sudduth 10:15 AM ET Aug 22. . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . .

Harvey continues to strengthen – winds are now 110 mph and pressure down to 947 millibars. . . .         . By  . Mark Sudduth.  . |.  .  . August 25, 2017.  .  - 2:06 AM.  . |.  .  .  . HurricaneTrack.com News/Information.  .  . . . . . The latest update from the NHC tells us that Harvey continues to strengthen over the very warm waters of the western Gulf of Mexico. Top winds are now 105 mph with a steadily falling pressure in the eye. Continued intensification is forecast and Harvey is likely to become a category three hurricane before landfall Friday night in to Saturday morning.. . . My biggest fear for Harvey is that a lot of people do not realize how bad this flooding rain and continuous tropical storm and hurricane conditions will be. We will likely lose our ability to use mobile Internet as I firmly believe the  infrastructure is going to fail and stay down for several days in a row. Power will be out, cell service will be non-existent and people will be on their own until things clear up – which could be three to four days AFTER landfall. I am not kidding – this is a bad, bad situation coming up for Texas.. . . Tomorrow morning, Friday, my team and I will begin setting up the remote cams and weather stations to capture and stream live what Harvey’s impacts are on the Texas coast. We will be live via YouTube for as long as we possibly can as conditions begin to worsen with the approach of the outer rain bands.. . . I have prepared a video discussion which is posted below – please take a look as it gives important information about where to find helpful information concerning what to expect from this dangerous hurricane.. . . . .

Military Black Hawk helicopters were used to airlift intensive care patients..

The facility manufactures organic peroxides, compounds used in everything from making pharmaceuticals to construction materials, which can become dangerous at higher temperatures. . Harris County and company officials said there had been no massive explosions at the site, as originally reported, but a fire in part of a container.. Pressure valves in the container had been released causing a popping sound, they said.. Richard Rennard, a senior executive at Arkema, said substances in another eight containers were expected to decompose in the same way as the first. He did not rule out explosions during the decomposition.. "It's not a chemical release that's happening. I want to be clear about that. What we have is a fire.". Mr Rennard added that he did not know how long the product would take to degrade, and advised residents to keep outside the exclusion zone.. . . . . . . . . Are you affected by Tropical Storm Harvey?

Donald Trump.  . Weather. Hurricane Harvey is strengthening as it approaches the Texas coast, and the massive storm is underscoring another big disturbance on the way: the battle over President Donald Trump’s proposed cuts to the .  National Weather Service. .. Charged with providing weather forecasts and warnings, the National Weather Service also makes its data available to hundreds of companies that use it for everything from smartphone applications to agricultural equipment. Trump earlier this year proposed cutting its budget by 6 percent and that of its parent agency, .  the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.  (NOAA), by a .  mammoth 16 percent. . It was an .  unprecedented proposal.  in the National Weather Service’s storied history, which extends back to 1890, when it was founded as the .  U.S. Weather Bureau. .. Trump also proposed huge subcuts for programs that engage in computer modeling of storms, as well as observation of storms and dissemination of data. .  Tsunami research and prediction would be cut. , along with supercomputing investments and a program to extend more accurate modeling to 30 days from 16, which could have huge benefits for everything from the insurance to the transportation industries..  . Keep up with this story and more . by subscribing now. The Trump proposal “is opposite to the ‘leave it better than you found it’ philosophy. This is take the money while you can, and let someone else in the future put Humpty Dumpty (aka NOAA) together again,” .  David Titley. , director of the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Penn State and a retired Navy rear admiral, .  told Climate Central. , a consortium.. Related: . Trump is putting us all at risk of more Hurricane Sandy flood disasters. Already, the U.S. is .  behind Europe in its forecast accuracy. , and further cuts to research would likely leave the country farther behind in what’s been called “climate intelligence.” The National Weather Service’s main forecasting model, the .  Global Forecasting System. , has seen a major drop-off in accuracy. The White House’s budget proposal would only make it worse. It seeks to cut 26 percent from NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which supports data collection, climate and science, as well as research into more accurate weather forecasting models. .  The budget blueprint also would cut $513 million from NOAA’s satellite division. , the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service, a 22 percent reduction.. Such cuts.  would cripple NOAA’s ability to keep afloat its satellites and data-gathering activities. That would not only affect the military but any business that relies on data and governments that have to plan how to handle snowstorms and hurricanes.. Scientists and meteorologists have worried that the cuts, and much more devastating reductions in climate change programs at NASA and other agencies, would harm the agency’s ability to forecast storms. In recent decades, the improvement in forecasting technologies has saved hundreds of lives, especially when it comes to tornadoes. .  The National Weather Service.  notes that hundreds used to die from pop up tornadoes like the ones that blew through Oklahoma in the mid-1970s, and that deaths are way down due to accurate predictions.. Harvey, which by the time it makes landfall in Texas this week is expected to be upgraded to a Category 3 hurricane, the first of that strength in more than 11 years, illustrates the point. The deadliest hurricane in U.S. history, which hit Galveston, Texas, in the year 1900, led to 6,000 to 12,000 deaths. By contrast, 72 deaths were associated with Superstorm Sandy in 2012 and fewer than 2,000 with Hurricane Katrina in 2005.. James Franklin, who headed the hurricane forecast team at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, a part of the National Weather Service, laments the budget cuts that are being proposed, including to the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program that was launched in 2009. “It’s hanging on really by a thread in terms of funding,” said Franklin.. Trump has yet to nominate an administrator to lead NOAA. . By contrast, President Barack Obama had named his pick before his 2009 swearing in. Speculation has centered on .  Barry Myers, the CEO of Accuweather. —a weather business—but he is not a scientist.. A Senate panel passed smaller cuts to NOAA; the cuts by the House panel were significantly closer to President Trump’s proposed reductions. . By the time a new budget is due in October, the country will be deep into hurricane season—as well as the fiscal budget storm.. Request Reprint.  or . Submit Correction.  . . . . . . . . .

Hurricane Harvey.  was an extremely destructive . Atlantic hurricane.  which became the first . major hurricane. [nb 1].  to make . landfall.  in the . United States.  since . Wilma.  in . 2005. , ending a record 12-year span in which no hurricanes made landfall at such an intensity in the country. In a four-day period, many areas received more than 40 inches (100 cm) of rain as the system slowly meandered over eastern Texas and adjacent waters, causing catastrophic flooding. With peak accumulations of 64.58 in (164.0 cm), Harvey was the . wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States. . The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes, displaced more than 30,000 people, and prompted more than 17,000 rescues. Harvey was the strongest hurricane in the . Gulf of Mexico.  since . Rita.  in . 2005. . Harvey was also one of three 2017 . Atlantic hurricanes.  to potentially cause at least 50 billion dollars in damages, along with . Hurricane Irma.  in .

The eighth . named storm. , third . hurricane. , and the first major hurricane of the . 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. , Harvey developed from a . tropical wave.  to the east of the . Lesser Antilles. , reaching . tropical storm.  status on August 17. The storm crossed through the . Windward Islands.  on the following day, passing just south of . Barbados.  and later near . Saint Vincent. . Upon entering the . Caribbean Sea. , Harvey began to weaken due to moderate . wind shear.  and degenerated into a tropical wave north of . Colombia.  early on August 19. The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west-northwestward across the Caribbean and the . Yucatán Peninsula. , before redeveloping over the . Bay of Campeche.  on August 23. Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August 24, regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day. While the storm moved generally northwest, Harvey's intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August 24–25; however, Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained Category 4 intensity later that day. Hours later, Harvey made landfall near . Rockport, Texas. , at peak intensity. Afterwards, rapid weakening ensued, and Harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline of the state, dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the Lone Star state. On August 28, it emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slightly before making a third and final landfall in . Louisiana.  on August 29. As Harvey drifted inland, it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September 1, before dissipating two days later.. . . Harvey caused at least 90 confirmed deaths: 1 in . Guyana. ,. [1].  and 89 in the United States.. [2]. [3]. [4]. [5].  Economic losses are preliminarily estimated at between $70 billion. [6].  to $200 billion,.

At the beginning of August 13, the . National Hurricane Center.  (NHC) began monitoring a . tropical wave.  on the western coast of Africa. Amid favorable environmental conditions, the wave was expected to merge with a broad . area of low pressure.  to its east southwest of . Cape Verde.  and gradually organize thereafter.. [8].  Instead, the two disturbances remained separate, with the broad trough continuing westward and the tropical wave moving farther north, eventually becoming . Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten. .. [9].  On August 17, shower and thunderstorm activity in association with the trough began to show signs of organization,. [10].  while high-resolution satellite showed an increasingly defined low-level circulation.. [11].  As such, the NHC initiated advisories on a potential tropical cyclone, allowing tropical storm watches and warnings to be hoisted for portions of the . Lesser Antilles. .. [12].  An . Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft.  deployed to the disturbance later that afternoon found a well-defined center and tropical storm-force winds, prompting the NHC to upgrade it to Tropical Storm Harvey at 21:00 UTC.. [13]. . . Following its designation, the cyclone moved swiftly westward into the . Caribbean Sea.  under the influence of an expansive . ridge of high pressure.  to its north. An environment of moderate . wind shear.  complicated the weather of the storm's intensity, with global forecast models suggesting dissipation in the central Caribbean, whereas statistical and hurricane models suggested the potential for Harvey to be near hurricane strength in later days.. [13].  Over the next day, the storm changed little in structure, remaining poorly organized with its low-level center on the eastern edge of associated deep . convection. .. [14].  Harvey's presentation began to deteriorate early on August 19; its convective pattern became elongated while the circulation became less defined. In fact, a reconnaissance aircraft was unable to find a loosely-closed circulation at 850 mb (4,781 ft), though it did locate one at lower levels.. [15].  Harvey was downgraded to a tropical depression at 21:00 UTC on August 19;. [16].  six hours later, based on continued data from a . reconnaissance aircraft. , it was declared an open . tropical wave. .. [17]. . . . . . . Play media. . . . . . View from a .

Although the effects of strong upper-level winds and dry air were expected to limit development in the near-term, conditions were expected to become more conducive to tropical storm and hurricane conditions when the disturbance entered the northwestern Caribbean Sea, and especially in the . Bay of Campeche. .. [18].  Despite an increase in convective organization, the disturbance still lacked a well-defined center as it approached the . Yucatán Peninsula. .. [19].  While traversing inland, satellite images and surface observations indicated that the circulation became better defined.. [20]. . . Regeneration, peak intensity, and stalling (Gulf of Mexico). [. edit. ]. . . A reconnaissance aircraft investigating the remnants of Harvey around 15:00 UTC on August 23 indicated that it once again acquired a well-defined center, and the NHC upgraded it to a tropical depression accordingly.. [21].  The system began to slowly consolidate amid an increasingly favorable environment,. [22].  attaining tropical storm intensity by 06:00 UTC on August 24.. [23].  Later that morning, Harvey began to undergo . rapid intensification.  as an . eye.  developed and its . central pressure.  quickly fell.. [24].  By 17:00 UTC, the storm was upgraded to the third hurricane of the season.. [25].  Slight entrainment of dry air slowed the intensification process, however, by the next day, Harvey was able to quickly strengthen into a Category 3 major hurricane by 19:00 UTC.. [26].  Further deepening occurred as the storm approached the coast of Texas, with Harvey becoming a Category 4 hurricane at 23:00 UTC, based on reconnaissance aircraft data.. [27].  Around 03:00 UTC on August 26, the hurricane made landfall at peak intensity at . Rockport.  with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and an . atmospheric pressure.  of 938 . mbar.  (27.7 . inHg. ).. [28].  Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since . Wilma.  in . 2005.  and the strongest in terms of wind speed to hit the country since . Charley.  in . 2004. . It was the first hurricane to strike Texas since . Hurricane Ike.  in . 2008. ,. [29].  the first major hurricane in the state since . Bret.  in . 1999. , and the strongest in Texas since . Carla.  in . 1961. .. [30]. . . . . . . . . . Harvey as a hurricane on August 24. . . . . . . After striking land, the storm moved over the . Copano Bay.  and made a second landfall in Texas just north of . Holiday Beach.  at 06:00 UTC on August 26 as a Category 3 hurricane.. [31].  Afterwards, rapid weakening ensued as its speed slowed dramatically to a crawl, and Harvey weakened to a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC on August 26.. [32].  For about two days the storm stalled just inland, dropping very heavy rainfall and causing widespread flash flooding. Harvey's center drifted back towards the southeast, positioning itself near or just off the Texas coast at . Matagorda.  by 15:00 UTC on August 28.. [33].  Once offshore, convection blossomed and allowed the once-exposed low-level circulation to become obscured. An Air Force reconnaissance plane investigating the system during the afternoon of August 29 found that maximum winds had increased to 50 mph (85 km/h).. [34].  Around 09:00 UTC the next morning, Harvey made its third and final landfall just west of . Cameron, Louisiana. , with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h).. [35]. . . Final landfall and dissipation (Eastern United States). [. edit. ]. . . The system continued north and then north-northeast, weakening to a tropical depression over central Louisiana around 00:00 UTC on August 30.. [36].  Associated convection with Harvey became focused north of the center and along a warm front on September 1, indicating that the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone by 15:00 UTC that day.. [37].  However, Harvey's remnants continued moving northeastward, while slowly weakening. Late on September 2, the WPC issued its final advisory on Harvey's remnant low, while it was located over . Ohio. .. [38].  Harvey's remnants continued to drift northward, before being absorbed by another low pressure system north of . Lake Erie. , late on September 3.. [39]. . . . . Preparations.

All watches and warnings were discontinued by late on August 18, as the storm continued westward into the Caribbean.. [40]. . . In Honduras, a green alert was issued for the . Atlántida. , .

About 8 inches (20 cm) of precipitation was expected along the coast, while inland areas were forecast to receive 2.76 to 3.15 in (7.0 to 8.0 cm) of rain.. [41].  As the remnants of Harvey approached Mexico, the Civil Protection Secretary of the state of . Campeche.  issued a blue alert, indicting minimal danger.. [42].  When Harvey redeveloped at 15:00 UTC on August 23, the . Government of Mexico.  issued a tropical storm watch in . Tamaulipas.  from Boca De Catan to the mouth of the . Rio Grande. .. [43].

Superfund. -designed . brownfield.  sites that contain a wide variety of toxins and carcinogens.. [157].  Two Superfund sites in Corpus Christi were flooded.. [157]. . . Environmental factors. [. edit. ]. . . The . Geography of Houston.  places it in a low-lying part of the . Gulf Coastal Plain. , and its . clay. -based soils provide poor drainage. The . climate of Houston.  brings very heavy rainfall, which together with tidal flood events means that there have been repeated floods in the city ever since its founding in 1836, though the flood control district founded in 1947, aided by the . U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. , managed to prevent statewide flooding for over fifty years. More recently, residents died in "historic flooding" in . May 2015. , and in the . April 2016 "tax day floods". .. [159]. [160].  There is a tendency for storms to move very slowly over the region, and drop huge amounts of rain over an extended period, as occurred during . Tropical Storm Claudette.  in 1979, and . Tropical Storm Allison.  in 2001.. [161]. . . The area is a very flat flood plain at shallow gradient, slowly draining rainwater through an intricate network of channels and bayous to the sea. The main waterways, the . San Jacinto River.  and the . Buffalo Bayou. , meander slowly, laden with mud, and have little capacity for carrying storm water.. [162]. . . Urban development. [. edit. ]. . . Houston has seen rapid urban development (. urban sprawl. ), with absorbent prairie and wetlands replaced by hard surfaces which rapidly shed storm water, overwhelming the drainage capacity of the rivers and channels.. [163].  Between 1992 and 2010, almost 25,000 acres of wetlands were lost, decreasing the detention capacity of the region by four billion gallons.. [164].  However, Harvey was estimated to have dropped more than fifteen trillion gallons of water in the area.. [165]. . . The Katy Prairie in western Harris County, which once helped to absorb floodwaters in the region, has been reduced to one quarter of its previous size in the last several decades due to . suburban development. , and one analysis discovered that more than 7,000 housing units have been built within the 100-year floodplain in Harris County since 2010.. [166]. . . Subsidence. [. edit. ]. . . Extraction of oil and groundwater from underground . aquifers.  leaves unsupported voids resulting in ground collapse, a process called . subsidence. . Houston itself is in a very large subsidence bowl, with smaller bowls within that area showing greater subsidence: in some cases as much as 9 feet (2.7 m). These result in drainage systems no longer having the required gradient to operate efficiently, so storm water drains more slowly.. [167].  The coastline near Houston has seen sea level increasing by 6 inches (15 cm) in recent decades due to subsidence combined with the . effects of climate change. .. [168]. [167]. . . Climate change. [. edit. ]. . . See also: . Tropical cyclone § Climate change. . . The . Gulf of Mexico.  is known for hurricanes in August, so their incidence alone cannot be attributed to . global warming. , but the warming climate does influence certain attributes of storms. Studies in this regard show that storms tend to intensify more rapidly prior to landfall.. [169].  Weather events are due to multiple factors, and so cannot be said to be caused by one precondition, but climate change affects aspects of extreme events, and very likely worsened some of the impacts of Harvey.. [170].  In a briefing, the . World Meteorological Organization.  stated that the quantity of rainfall from Harvey had very likely been increased by climate change. The relationship between climate change and the frequency of hurricanes (or tropical cyclones) is still unclear, and is the subject of continuing research.. [171]. . . Harvey approached Houston over sea-surface waters which were significantly above average temperatures. Warm waters provide the main source of energy for hurricanes, and increased ocean heat can result in storms being larger, more intense and longer lasting, in particular bringing greatly increased rainfall.. [172]. [169].  . Sea level rise.  added to the resulting problems.. [170].  According to officials from the Harris County Flood Control District, Harvey caused the third '500-year' flood in three years. . [173]. [174]. [175].  The . National Climate Assessment.  states:. . . . . The recent increases in activity are linked, in part, to higher sea surface temperatures in the region that Atlantic hurricanes form in and move through. Numerous factors have been shown to influence these local sea surface temperatures, including natural variability, human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases, and particulate pollution. Quantifying the relative contributions of natural and human-caused factors is an active focus of research.. [176]. . . . . Warmer air can hold more water vapour, in accordance with the . Clausius–Clapeyron relation. , and there has been a global increase of daily rainfall records.. [170].  Regional . sea surface temperatures.  around Houston have risen around 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) in recent decades, which caused a 3–5% increase in moisture in the atmosphere. This had the effect of allowing Harvey to strengthen more than expected.. [168].  The water temperature of the Gulf of Mexico was above average for this time of the year, and likely to be a factor in Harvey's impact.. [177].  Within a week of Harvey . Hurricane Irma.  formed due to the same unusually warm sea-water. Some scientists fear this may be becoming a 'new normal'. Also higher sea-water temperatures can make hurricanes more devastating.. [178]. . . The slow movement of Harvey over Texas allowed the storm to drop prolonged heavy rains on the state, as has also happened with earlier storms.. [161].  Harvey's stalled position was due to weak prevailing winds linked to a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the US at the time, which had pushed the jet stream to the north. Research and model simulations have indicated an association between this pattern and human-caused climate change.. [168]. [179]. . . See also. [. edit. ]. . . . .

The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline in Texas was $2.17 a gallon on Sunday morning, up only 2 cents from the beginning of the week, according to the AAA motor club, below the national average of $2.36 a gallon, also up 2 cents this week. The reason is a glut of oil and gasoline in storage, due to a frenzy of drilling in shale fields across the country, but especially in Texas, in recent years.. However, it may take days before the full impact of the storm is known. Roughly a million barrels a day of refining capacity has been shut down on the Gulf Coast, and nearly a quarter of Gulf offshore production has been shut in. The Corpus Christi shipping terminals responsible for importing and exporting oil and refined products are also closed, and if the ship channel between Port Aransas and Aransas Pass is badly damaged it could take weeks for production to resume. . — CLIFFORD KRAUSS in Houston. The energy infrastructure bears watching.. Few, if any, places in the world have as much energy infrastructure in harm’s way as the Gulf of Mexico coast. Houston, Corpus Christi, Texas City and other cities have vast refineries and natural gas terminals, which make and store dangerous chemicals. The Gulf itself is crisscrossed by oil and natural gas pipelines that connect production platforms to pipelines onshore. The potential for environmental catastrophe, or at least a crippling blow to the national economy, is always there when a hurricane hits. But the region’s energy complex has dodged many bullets over the years.. The last major hurricane to hit Texas was Ike in 2008. It barreled into Galveston, Tex., only miles from Texas City and the Houston ship channel, and its high concentration of refineries and chemical plants. There was no disaster, but the ports of Freeport, Texas City, and Lake Charles, La. remained closed for days and flooding knocked out power to some refineries for more than a week.. More serious was the potential for trouble on the seas. Several drilling rigs were destroyed and underwater pipelines were damaged, but it appears that leaks were limited.. There have been no reports of significant leaks from Harvey so far, but damage assessments can take weeks. The brunt of the storm hit the ship channel between Port Aransas and Aransas Pass, where oil tankers come and go to Corpus Christi. Serious flooding could block commerce for days or weeks. . — CLIFFORD KRAUSS in Houston. . . . . Follow some of the experts..

CORPUS CHRISTI, Tex. — Hurricane Harvey made landfall on the Central Texas coast as a Category 4 storm late Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center, which warned of catastrophic flooding from the storm surge and torrential rains.. The eye of the storm swept ashore with 130-mile-per-hour winds about 9:45 p.m. between Port Aransas and Port O’Connor, just northeast of Corpus Christi. But as the center of the storm moved to the northeast toward Victoria and other inland cities, the danger was just starting.. “Even though #Harvey has made landfall, the rainfall threat is only beginning,” the National Hurricane Center said in a Twitter message.. Later, the storm made a second landfall — on the Northeastern Shore of Copano Bay. The hurricane was downgraded to a Category 3, with 125 m.p.h. winds..  .

Texas Medical Center, one of the largest medical complexes in the world, is in Houston, and officials there awaited the worst with a full complement of patients on site. “We are hunkered down,” said William McKeon, the center’s president and chief executive, speaking by phone from his office as the hurricane made landfall about 200 miles southwest of the city.. In nearby coastal Galveston, about 120 patients remained at the University of Texas Medical Branch’s Jennie Sealy Hospital on Friday night, said Chris Smith-Gonzalez, a media relations officer. The hospital opened last year and was “built to withstand a significant hurricane,” he said, after Hurricane Ike caused severe damage to the former medical campus in 2008.. Refineries in the Houston and Beaumont-Port Arthur areas, both nerve centers for the nation’s energy industry, shut down operations in preparation for the storm, sending jitters through global energy markets.. To be called a major storm, a hurricane must be Category 3 or higher on the . Saffi. r-Simpson.  scale, which means winds of 111 to 129 m.p.h. Those winds can bring devastating damage, stripping off roof decking and bringing down many trees. Ike was a Category 2, though it pushed a monster storm surge. Sandy, despite the devastation it caused, had become what is known as a post-tropical storm before it made landfall..  . Continue reading the main story. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times        . . . . . . . . . . . . . Forecasters emphasized that it was not just the wind that made Harvey dangerous. Storm surge, the water that a hurricane pushes ahead of it, can be tremendously destructive. Katrina, one of the deadliest and costliest hurricanes in United States history, inflicted much of its harm in 2005 in New Orleans through the surge, which overwhelmed the area’s faulty levees.. . . . . Advertisement. . . . . Continue reading the main story. . . . . The sense of anxiety and confusion that preceded landfall was exacerbated Friday by mixed messages from state and local officials. The conflicting views from the Republican governor and the Democratic mayor of Houston reflected the tension that has come to define much of Texas politics.. At an afternoon news conference, Governor Abbott strongly urged Houstonians to consider evacuating. “I think it would be a good idea to take a few days off, get out of the Houston area,” he said.. Soon after the governor’s message, Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, who for days had been telling residents to shelter in place, advised in a Twitter post: “Please think twice before trying to leave Houston en masse. No evacuation orders have been issued for the city.”. But while forecasters were warning of epic rains in Houston, some in the city were approaching the storm with aplomb..  .

Credit. .             Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times        . . . . . . . . . . . . . “We’ve never evacuated,” said Rita Kehoe Welsh, 97, who sat calmly Friday at the Bellaire Coffee Shop, working on a crossword puzzle. Asked how she was preparing for the storm, she laughed and said, “I’m not.”. In Port Aransas, on a barrier island in the Gulf of Mexico, the authorities issued mandatory evacuation orders, fearing that life-threatening flooding and winds would batter the town.. Frank Eicholz, 55, and his wife were among those who evacuated their home there. Mr. Eicholz, a local fishing guide, grew up on the Gulf Coast, and remembers Hurricane Celia in 1970, which struck Corpus Christi when he was 8.. . . . . Advertisement. . . . . Continue reading the main story. . . . . “I can remember there wasn’t a single fence standing after Celia,” he said. “It ripped part of our roof off our house. For an 8-year-old kid, that’s kind of scary.”. When a Spec’s liquor store opened in Houston on Friday morning, it did not have to wait long for customers: About 125 of them had lined up outside in the rain. By early afternoon, the store’s manager, Ryan Holder, estimated that about 3,000 people had passed through, filling the parking lot and then their cars with wine and not a few kegs of beer.. But, as double the usual number of customers came through the door, water was crucial.. “Water, ice, beer,” Mr. Holder said. “We have a ton of water. We went through 31 pallets of them yesterday. We’ve gone through 20 so far today. We’ve got 40 more on the way. We ain’t running out.”. . . . . Manny Fernandez reported from Corpus Christi, Tex., and Alan Blinder from Houston.

Harvey.  slowly moves across the state, stalling over the southeast and producing a “multiday rainfall disaster” over the next five to six days, according to the National Hurricane Center.. Forecasters are expecting.  15 to 30 inches of rain and isolated amounts as high as 40 inches, said Michael Brennan, the acting chief of the center’s Hurricane Specialist Unit.. The greater Houston area has already gotten more than 5 inches of rain, Dr. Brennan said. Areas in far South Texas, the Texas Hill Country and southwest and central Louisiana could see 5 to 15 inches of rain.. A storm surge warning is in effect from Port Aransas to High Island, Tex., the National Hurricane Center said, which means a dangerous amount of rising water is expected to move inland.. . .

Coastal areas from Baffin Bay to High Island are currently at risk for tropical storm conditions, while hurricane warnings continue for inland areas.. During tropical cyclones, “wind tends to get all the attention,” but “water is what kills most people,” Dr. Brennan said.. As the storm weakens, the rainfall threat will not change, Dr. Brennan said, and it can lead to flash flooding that occurs with little warning, as well as river flooding.. “Rainfall doesn’t care how strong the storm is,” he added.. A recent study.  by the American Meteorological Society showed that storm surges and rainfall were responsible for about 76 percent of the fatalities from Atlantic tropical cyclones in the United States from 1963 to 2012.. The extent of surge-related flooding depends on how high the tide is when the surge occurs. If peak surge happens during high tide, areas from Port Aransas to Sargent could see as much as 7 feet of water above ground..  . Continue reading the main story. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Hours before Hurricane Harvey was expected to make landfall, the governor and the mayor of Houston seemed at odds about whether to evacuate the nation’s fourth-largest city.. Gov. Greg Abbott had warned at a news conference that the storm was shaping up to be “more dangerous” than previous hurricanes because of the potential for widespread flooding that could leave Texas in the storm’s grip for at least “a week if not longer.”. Houston officials had recommended that most residents wait out the storm in the flood-prone city. But on Friday, Mr. Abbott abruptly urged a different approach.. “I would urge people to strongly consider the evacuation process,” Mr. Abbott said during a news conference. “There is a possibility, the probability, that a lot of people will go for a long time without the basic necessities.”. . . . .

Some things are known with growing certainty — rising sea levels makes storm surge worse. Others, not so much.. One unresolved question, Mr. Schwartz writes, is whether climate change is affecting the number and the intensity of the storms. It could be making some stronger, and certainly wetter. In the article, . Katharine Hayhoe. , a climate scientist at Texas Tech and one of the authors of . a sweeping climate science.  report, notes that scientists are not saying that hurricanes are necessarily caused by climate change, but are being affected by them.. “We care about a changing climate because it exacerbates the natural risks and hazards that we already face,” she said. “People always want to know is it climate change or is it not?

JOHN SCHWARTZ. Refineries are bracing for impact.. Refineries across the Texas coast have shut down their operations as workers laid sandbags to lessen the possibility of saltwater flooding into their operations.. Gasoline prices were bound to rise, at least for a few days, because Corpus Christi and Houston, major refinery hubs, are in the primary target zone of winds of over 100 miles an hour, surging tides and heavy rains. While oil prices have not soared even as many offshore production platforms have been shut, gasoline futures in New York have risen to their highest levels of the summer driving season. So far, though, prices at the pump around the Gulf region remain at historically low levels for this time of year, and more than a dime below the national average of $2.35..

It’s not just the wind, it’s the water.. Forecasters are saying this is the first major hurricane to hit the United States in 12 years. That’s the kind of statement that is accurate, but galling for those who went through storms like . Sandy.  in the Northeast in 2012, or . Ike. , which was so destructive to the Texas Gulf Coast in 2008.. The distinction is this: to be called a major storm, a hurricane must be Category 3 or higher on the . Saffer-Simpson hurricane wind scale. , which means winds of 111 to 129 miles an hour. Those winds can bring “devastating” damage, stripping off roof decking and bringing down many trees. Ike was a Category 2, though it pushed a monster storm surge. Sandy had become what is known as a post-tropical storm before it made landfall. Late Friday, Hurricane Harvey became a Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 130 miles per hour.. The lesson is that it is not just wind that makes a storm dangerous. Storm surge, the water that a hurricane pushes ahead of it, can be tremendously destructive. Much more harm was done to New Orleans during Katrina because of the surge — which overwhelmed the area’s faulty levees — than the wind.. . . . . Beyond surge is the rainwater. . Tropical Storm Allison.  was not even at hurricane strength when it came to Houston in 2001, but it sat over the city in much the way that Harvey is expected to do. Southeast Texas suffered . nearly $5 billion in damage from the storm, with 22 deaths. . — . JOHN SCHWARTZ. Mexican authorities issue safety warnings..

Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times        . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ROCKPORT, Tex. — Hurricane Harvey bombarded a stretch of the Gulf Coast in Texas on Saturday with home-ripping winds and epic rains. As emergency officials scrambled to assess the extent of the damage, hundreds of thousands of people were without power after utility poles were knocked to the ground as if they were twigs.. The storm made landfall here in the coastal city of Rockport, ripping away roofs, leveling palm trees and road signs, and turning ranch land into lakes. Mayor Charles J. Wax said Saturday that conditions were too dangerous to send out emergency officials but that an initial review, as the storm’s eye passed overnight, had found “widespread damage.”. “We took a Category 4 storm right on the nose,” the mayor said.. Those who rode out the storm were in awe of Harvey’s power. Standing by his ripped-up home in Sienna Plantation, a community southwest of Houston, Jamie Ellis, 48, said he had been watching a movie about 1 a.m. Saturday when a tornado swept through that sounded “like a freight train was coming.” The lights went out, the upstairs French doors flew open, and objects began careening around inside his house. He, his wife, Stacie, and his son, Zach, took refuge in a bedroom closet.. . . Photo. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Leyla Chaves and her mother, Rebecca Canales, looking at the damage caused by the hurricane in Victoria.. . . . . Credit. .             Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times        . . . . . . . Harvey was the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since 2005, and it was expected to hover over Texas until at least midweek. A fierce Category 4 hurricane when it struck land on Friday night, it eased by Saturday into a tropical storm. Still, meteorologists warned that as much as three feet of rain could fall across a vast area from Corpus Christi to Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city.. . . . . Advertisement. . . . .

By midnight, the authorities had reported two deaths that appeared to be related to the storm, one in Rockport and the other in Houston. But forecasters warned that Harvey’s onslaught was just beginning. In an advisory on Saturday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was already producing “torrential rains,” and it warned that “catastrophic flooding” was likely in the days ahead..  .

Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times        . . . . . . . . . . . . . At a news conference in Austin, Gov. Greg Abbott said Saturday afternoon that officials remained active in search and rescue efforts. “We don’t have any information right now that we can confirm” about deaths, he said.. The storm remained a hurricane well after it made landfall about 10 p.m. Friday, and the deluge of rain made it difficult for the authorities to conduct even preliminary damage assessments. More than 250,000 Texans were without electricity on Saturday, a figure that was likely to increase.. The authorities ordered evacuations over a wide area of the state.. A few miles outside Rockport, a recreational vehicle lay on its side in the middle of a two-lane highway with its roof ripped off and an orange X spray-painted on its bumper, an apparent signal by emergency workers that the vehicle had been checked for people inside and cleared. A small herd of longhorn cattle waded through a flooded field, searching for dry ground..  . Continue reading the main story. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Photo. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Concerned about rising floodwaters, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice . evacuated.  about 4,500 inmates on Saturday from prisons near the Brazos River to locations in East Texas.. In Houston, the lights began to blink and, in some places, go out. The city’s bayous were rising, and its roads, mostly quiet since Friday night, remained eerily empty. Although Houston, a city of about 2.3 million, is among the nation’s most flood-prone major cities, the local authorities did not order an evacuation.. . . Video. . . . .

Juan Cruz, 52, bought a tarpaulin from a Walmart north of downtown to help cover his leaky roof. He lived through Hurricane Mitch in Honduras in 1998 and remembered how it had killed his neighbors, flooded roads and torn up bridges.. . . . . Advertisement. . . . .

Nearby, a homeless man, Roy Joe Cox, 63, pulled a rolling suitcase. “A hurricane is coming, and I have nowhere to go,” he said.. Tears formed in his sky blue eyes. He normally lives under a nearby bridge, he said, and was hoping to get a blanket to protect him from the incoming storm. “I’m not a thief,” he said. “But I was going to steal it, because I don’t have any money.”.  .

Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times        . . . . . . . . . . . . . President Trump, facing the first significant natural disaster of his administration, issued a federal disaster declaration on Friday. The order, requested by Mr. Abbott, covers six Texas counties and opens the spigot for federal aid.. The storm forced hundreds of flight cancellations, partly because Southwest Airlines and United Airlines have major presences in Houston, according to FlightAware, which monitors air traffic. Two cruise ships that were scheduled to return to Galveston, Tex., on Saturday were diverted to New Orleans.. The storm took an unusual path toward meteorological infamy. The system first became Tropical Storm Harvey on Aug. 17, when it was about 250 miles east of Barbados. Two days later, it disintegrated into a tropical wave. But on Wednesday, the system gained new and startling power, and forecasters issued the first hurricane watches for the Texas coast..  . Continue reading the main story. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times        . . . . . . . . . . . . . By Friday night, fed by stable air and the Gulf of Mexico’s warm waters, it had grown into a Category 4 storm with sustained wind speeds of 130 m.p.h. In years past, major hurricanes caused immediate spikes in . oil.  and gasoline prices, but as hard as Hurricane Harvey has hit the region’s refineries, the impact at the pump has so far been muted.. However, it may take days before the full impact of the storm is known. Roughly a million barrels a day of refining capacity has been shut down on the Gulf Coast, and nearly a quarter of gulf offshore production has been shut. The Corpus Christi shipping terminals responsible for importing and exporting oil and refined products are also closed. And if the ship channel between Port Aransas and Aransas Pass is badly damaged, it could take weeks for products to leave South Texas refineries, even if the plants are not harmed.. . . . . Advertisement. . . . . Continue reading the main story. . . . . Gasoline shortages are already appearing around Houston, where drivers have been waiting in long lines to fill up. Dozens of gasoline stations have run out of fuel in the metropolitan area, and prices at the pump have risen about 3 cents a gallon around the city this week.. Few if any places in the world have as much energy infrastructure in harm’s way as the Gulf of Mexico coast. Houston, Corpus Christi, Texas City and other cities have vast refineries and . natural gas.  terminals, which make and store dangerous chemicals. The gulf itself is crisscrossed by oil and natural gas pipelines that connect production platforms to pipelines onshore. The potential for environmental catastrophe, or at least a crippling blow to the national economy, is always there when a hurricane strikes.. The region’s energy complex has dodged many bullets over the years, but damage assessments after a hurricane hits can take weeks.. The last time a hurricane hit Texas was 2008, when Hurricane Ike barreled into Galveston, only miles from Texas City and the Houston Ship Channel and their high concentration of refineries and chemical plants. There was no disaster, but the ports of Freeport, Texas City and Lake Charles, La., remained closed for days, and extensive flooding crippled some refineries and left them without power for more than a week.. . . . .

Stephan Savoia/Associated Press        . . . . . . . . . WASHINGTON — Facing what could be the most powerful storm to slam into the United States in more than a decade, President Trump and the team he has put in place at the . Federal Emergency Management Agency.  were bracing on Friday for one of the most important tests of his presidency.. The stakes could be exceedingly high. Few events test the effectiveness of an administration — or bear as many political risks — like a major natural disaster.. The storm, Hurricane Harvey, made.  landfall.  near Corpus Christi, Tex., as a Category 4 hurricane late Friday. It is predicted to pummel the South Texas coast with winds exceeding 110 miles an hour and up to three feet of rain. After making landfall, forecasters predicted, the storm would make a turn back up the coast toward Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city and home to the oil and gas industry.. Mr. Trump used the power of his preferred megaphone, his Twitter account, to signal to his more than 36 million followers on Friday that he was closely watching the storm, as members of his administration sought to project that they were on top of the looming crisis.. . . . .

Bossert, told reporters on Friday that the president has been in close touch with the governors of Texas and Louisiana, the two states most likely to be affected.

Mr. Long, . a former director.  of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, is leading the federal response effort. His selection has been well received by emergency managers around the country, who say Mr. Long is battle-tested and well-connected with the states’ emergency teams. The Senate confirmed his appointment in June with a 95 to 4 vote.. Mr. Long’s Obama-era predecessor, W. Craig Fugate, declined on Friday to expound on the agency’s preparations, but he had good words to say about the administrator.. “Brock can speak for himself,” he wrote in an email. “But he knows hurricanes.”. Mr. Long said on Friday that the agency stood ready to respond and was working closely with Texas and Louisiana. It had established an incident support base at Randolph Air Force Base Auxiliary Airport near Seguin, Tex., roughly 125 miles inland from where the storm was expected to make landfall. Personnel there were stockpiling 96,000 liters of water and 306,000 meals, as well as supplies like blankets and tarps for affected communities.. The agency also placed teams to assist in the response at emergency posts in Austin and in Baton Rouge, La.. FEMA was being assisted by the Coast Guard, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In . a joint statement.  on Friday, I.C.E. and C.B.P. said they would continue to operate in the affected area but that they would not conduct “routine noncriminal immigration enforcement operations” at evacuation sites or assistance centers.. . . . .

Bush’s response to Katrina, which pummeled New Orleans in August 2005, crippling the city and leaving well over 1,500 people dead. The response of Mr. Bush’s FEMA administrator, Michael D. Brown, and the perception the president had incorrectly assessed the storm’s impact, are widely thought to have undermined the rest of his presidency.. Mr. Bush’s assertion at a news conference, even as the agency was mismanaging its response, that Mr. Brown was doing a “heck of a job,” became a national punch line. . Mr. Brown resigned.  a few days later.. Paul M. Rosen, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama, said the agency that . rebuilt itself.  in the wake of the crisis continues to be guided by the lessons of Katrina.. “I think post-Katrina, from a preparation standpoint, one of the lessons was prepare, prepare, prepare — and when you are done preparing, prepare a little more,” Mr. Rosen said. “There is now a mind-set to get ready for the worst.”. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of landlocked Iowa, sharply warned the president that he would do well to study Katrina, lest he feel the consequences.. . . . . . . @realDonaldTrump.  . #hurricane.  keep on top of hurricane Harvey dont mke same mistake Pres Bush made w Katrina        .  —.         ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley).         . Aug. 25, 2017. . . . . . . . . Mr. Bossert said that the storm was indeed on the minds of federal and state officials, though he said he was hesitant to make direct comparisons between the two hurricanes before Harvey moved ashore.. “What we have done is gotten a lot better as a government,” Mr. Bossert said. Congress has passed “laws to give us the flexibility we need to employ, not just deploy, resources in the case of an event.”. . .

Mr. Bossert and the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, suggested Mr. Trump would remain engaged with the storm this weekend from Camp David in Maryland, where he traveled Friday afternoon.. . . . .

Mr. Bossert said he expected Mr. Trump would directly address the nation when he felt it was appropriate, and Ms. Sanders said that the president would be looking to make plans to visit the affected area as early next week.. Officials also continued to played down concerns that vacancies at other top government posts, including the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, would hinder the government’s response. Ms. Sanders said on Thursday that Mr. Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general who was the department’s secretary before becoming chief of staff, would be “sitting next to the president throughout this process.”. But Mr. Kelly’s old post is not the only relevant position without a permanent occupant. Two deputy director nominees at FEMA still await confirmation. Mr. Trump has not yet nominated someone to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center. And the center itself is in the midst of a director search, after its last director, Rick Knabb, left in May to become an on-air expert at the Weather Channel.. The administration’s proposed budget cuts to FEMA and NOAA were likewise attracting renewed attention on Friday, as the agencies dominated the news.. The administration has . recommended slashing.  FEMA programs and grants that help cities and states prepare for natural disasters to the tune of $667 million. That includes cuts to the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program, which provides funding states and cities to better withstand the impact of hurricanes and coastal storms.. At NOAA, . recommendations included.  a 16 percent cut to the overall budget and a 32 percent cut to the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the agency’s main ocean, weather and climate research office.. . . . .

Relatives of the Saldivar family comfort each other outside their house in Monterrey, Mexico.. . . . . Credit. .             Daniel Becerril/Reuters        . . . . . . . . . One couple had just another stop or two in their pickup truck, a check on an elderly uncle. A 60-year-old woman had just lain down for a much-needed nap. An 8-year-old boy was riding in a van with his extended family in search of higher ground.. All were claimed by Hurricane Harvey, which brought torrential rains and catastrophic flooding as it churned through southeast Texas for days. Beyond the billions in damage to homes, businesses and roads, the storm has taken a human toll, so far claiming the lives of at least 50 people across eight counties, officials said, a number that is expected to grow as rescue efforts shift to recovery.. As the floodwaters recede, the picture of Harvey’s devastation is becoming clearer. But the range of victims and their circumstances, with some found alone in their homes and others lost while undertaking rescue operations, reflect the wide reach of a storm that battered young and old alike.. The search for the dead is far from complete, as volunteers and relief workers move door to door and sift through the wreckage.. . . Photo. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Nearly all of those killed in the storm drowned. Many have not yet been identified, including a 65-year-old man who was seen collapsing in floodwaters.. Six members of the Saldivar family — Belia and Manuel and their four great-grandchildren — Devy, 16; Dominic, 14; Xavier, 8; and Daisy, 6 — were found dead in a van, which was submerged in high water in east Houston.. Two people died because they could not get the necessary medical treatment, officials said.. There were those who braved the storm willingly, steering boats and cars through rising waters. Surviving family members said this week that their relatives were aware of the dangers of a storm that was bigger and more ferocious than any they had ever seen, but were overcome by a desire to help those who were imperiled.. Some victims lived alone and died solitary deaths. They called and texted loved ones with reassuring messages as the storm took hold, only to be found lifeless the next day.. In Galveston County, three men, aged 54, 59 and 83, were each found alone after the storm, drowned in their houses. Galveston attracts outdoorsy, headstrong, “loner-type folks,” said Erin Barnhart, the county medical examiner, noting that after days of searching, officials there have yet to locate the next of kin for one of the men.. “Presumably they were attempting to ride out the storm,” she said on Friday, adding that surviving previous hurricanes in Galveston could have left some residents feeling invincible. “They think they can handle it. They may have been a stubborn old man who said, ‘I’ve lived my life and if this is it, this is it.’”. A few of the victims died under unknown circumstances, leaving relatives and friends anguished over what they might have endured in their final hours.. . . Newsletter Sign Up. . .

Agnes Stanley, 89, a longtime volunteer for a conservation group in Houston, died in her one-story brick home there on Sunday. She was found floating in four feet of floodwater. “We don’t know what happened,” a son, Gregory Stanley, said.. . . Photo. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Ruben Jordan told his son he was going to a sports bar to watch the fight. It was the last time the family heard from him.. . . . . Credit. .             Clear Creek Independent School District        . . . . . . . Roger Jordan, 35, heard from his 58-year-old father, Ruben Jordan, on Saturday evening, as the storm settled over Houston. “He had said he was going to go out to a sports bar and watch the fight,” he said, referring to the bout between . Floyd Mayweather.  Jr. and Conor McGregor. . Ruben Jordan, who had a long career as a high school teacher and football coach, went missing and drowned in the storm.. As Harvey raged this week, social media platforms quickly became clearinghouses for people looking for friends and relatives. Deborah Tucker of Baytown, Tex., posted on Facebook that her husband was missing. “His name is Mike Tucker, 66 yrs old, approx. 5’9,” she wrote. “I am very worried for his safety and appreciate any information.”. Later, an update appeared: “He has been found and didn’t make it. ThK u all for ur prayers. This is her daughter and she needs time before talking.”. While many in southeast Texas banded together to survive, there were others who died after venturing out to help others. Jorge Raul Perez, 33, and Yahir Rubio-Vizuet, 45, were killed in a boating accident while on a search-and-rescue mission in Harris County, their family said, adding that two men who joined them remain missing.. Sgt. Steve Perez, 60, a 34-year veteran of the Houston Police Department, drove in the dark for hours on Sunday morning while attempting to get to work; police said he had reached an underpass, had driven into the water and drowned.. Thelma Hooker, of Katy, Tex., said she was still trying to piece together the events of Wednesday, when her brother, Donald Rogers, called her to say that he and his wife, Rochelle, were busy checking on relatives, but would be home soon. They just needed to be satisfied, he told his sister, that everybody was all right.. “He didn’t come and I started getting worried,” Ms. Hooker said. Her phone soon rang with a frantic message, passed from a cousin to Ms. Hooker’s sister to her: There was a white truck in the raging water in nearby Fulshear, west of Houston, and it looked like their brother’s.. “The police officer said the current was so strong, it just wiped them off the bridge,” Ms. Hooker said, adding that she could not make sense of the situation. “My brother was a minister. He followed every rule.”. JoDell Pasek, of Houston, wept on Thursday as she described what had happened to her youngest son, Andrew, who was 25. An animal lover who once pulled over his car in San Antonio to rescue two abandoned puppies, Andrew was worried about his sister’s cat, D’Artagnan, left in her two-story house when she evacuated.. “He was a selfless person,” Ms. Pasek said. “He found out that they couldn’t take the cat with them, so he decided he was going to go over there.”. After parking his car, Andrew began wading through shallow floodwaters and was electrocuted, possibly by a live wire, according to Harris County officials.. Before he died, he shouted at a friend who had tagged along, Sean Stuart, not to touch him. “He knew immediately that if Sean touched him, he would be electrocuted too,” Ms. Pasek said.. . . . .

Bryan Sims. 4 Min Read. HOUSTON (Reuters) - For Texas residents affected by Hurricane Harvey, life in the storm’s aftermath involves juggling insurance claims, home repairs and work. But coping with loss is stirring very different feelings. .

Staff at the Sugar Land campus of the University of Houston began their first day at work on Tuesday sharing storm experiences and consoling those whose homes were damaged. . “It’s very healing for people,” Kathryn Tart, dean of the university’s College of Nursing, said. “It helps us move on to the really difficult next stage - rebuilding.”  . In an area of West Houston where some 3,000 homes suffered severe flooding and where water releases from two reservoirs continue to swamp neighborhoods, anger surfaced. . “I look out my kitchen window and there is a river that will always be there,” said Bryant Banes, who is a lawyer. He filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government in federal court claiming damages to his and neighbors’ homes and businesses from the reservoir releases.  . The decision to release waters to relieve pressure on the reservoirs amounted to an improper taking of property, the lawsuit claims. “People have lost their homes and it is their responsibility to compensate residents,” Banes said. . Harvey hit Corpus Christi in southern Texas on Aug. 25 but took the greatest toll on Houston and areas east of the city. The storm killed as many as 60 people, dumped more than 50 inches (127 cm) of rain and caused damages estimated as high as $180 billion, including to 312,000 homes along the coast. .

The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday approved roughly $8 billion in initial emergency aid for Harvey relief and rebuilding. A Senate vote is expected later this week.  . In Houston’s theater district, which sits along a drainage bayou, performances have been canceled indefinitely as assessments of repairs continue. Houston Grand Opera, Hobby Center for the Performing Arts and Alley Theatre reported flooding to some buildings and parking areas. . Slideshow.  (15 Images). In east Texas, Hardin County residents were only able to return to homes on Tuesday. “Water is just now receding,” said Theresa Wigley, the county’s emergency management coordinator. “Recovery is going to be slow.” . The number of people reported missing in Houston, which climbed as high as 137 last week, was down to 18 on Wednesday as families reunited, said Beth Alberts, head of the Texas Center for the Missing.  . “It is tragic and wonderful when we can match up people,” she said.  . At the same time, more of the region’s energy industry was coming back online. Refiner Phillips 66 (. PSX.N. ) said on Wednesday its Sweeny, Texas, refinery would return to full production by mid-month. Gasoline futures RBC1, which spiked last week, were off 2 percent on Wednesday.   . Two other storms are threatening energy infrastructure in the Caribbean and Mexico. Hurricane Irma is taking aim at Puerto Rico and Florida, and Tropical Storm Katia is off the Mexican state of Veracruz and forecast to become a hurricane in a couple of days, the National Weather Service said on Wednesday. .

The storm may have ruined up to one million vehicles along the Texas Gulf Coast, according to automotive data firm Black Book. In the Houston area, about one in seven cars may have been destroyed, according to analysts from Evercore ISI, an investment banking advisory and research firm.. Michael and Pansy Granberry took two feet of water into their home in the suburb of Friendswood.. But losing three cars felt almost as painful as the damage to their home that will require extensive repairs.The couple suspects all three vehicles suffered electrical damage that will be too expensive to fix.. "The Lexus is gone, the Cadillac, my favorite, I just bought at the end of February, won't do nothing — it's just blown," Michael Granberry says. "We've already talked to the insurance company, and they said they will be out soon to take care of it.". In the meantime, they were scrambling to find a rental, which are in high demand, to get around.. Harvey destroyed about 300,000 to 500,000 vehicles owned by individuals, Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke estimates. Insurance is expected to cover a large portion of those losses..

After Hurricane Harvey: Tips for filing an insurance claim. Charting Hurricane Harvey's jaw-dropping size and destruction. Smoke's projections were based on Houston-area storm damage and vehicle ownership, compared with scrappage rates and insurance claims following Superstorm Sandy in the New York region in 2012 and  Hurricane Katrina in the New Orleans area in 2005.. Vehicle ownership rates are higher in Houston than in New Orleans during Katrina and New York during Sandy. . Houston has 1.8 vehicles per household compared with 1.6 in New Orleans and 1.3 in New York during the earlier catastrophes. . Sandy is believed to have destroyed about 250,000 vehicles, while Katrina ruined about 200,000, according to Cox Automotive.. Other research estimates Katrina's destruction at closer to half a million cars and trucks, but those figures include vehicles that may have been wrecked by storms that occurred in the region later, including Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Wilma.. "It makes sense that the total vehicles damaged will be more severe than we saw in either of those cases," Smoke says, adding that 300,000 is "a fairly conservative estimate" and that 500,000 is "clearly plausible.".

Another 366,000 new vehicles stored on dealership lots were probably "affected," with about 150,000 to 200,000 of those cars and trucks located in the hardest-hit areas, Jessica Caldwell, an analyst for car-buying website Edmunds, estimates.. Black Book says more than 500 dealerships in the Houston area were affected. That included all 17 stores owned by AutoNation, the largest dealership network in the U.S., which reopened its locations Thursday.. Black Book estimates the number of vehicles that must be replaced at 500,000 to one million.. For victims of the disaster, auto insurance checks won't take long to start arriving. Auto sales in the region will likely start accelerating by late September or early October, says Chris Hopson, an auto analyst with IHS Markit, a research firm. . But in the short term, U.S. auto sales will take a hit. Automakers likely sold tens of thousands fewer vehicles than expected because of the storm, according to several estimates. The Harvey region represents about 30% to 40% of Texas sales, which account for up to 9% of U.S. sales, according to Barclays..

At 11 p.m. Friday, Harvey was centered about 30 miles east-northeast of Corpus Christi, tracking toward the northwest at 8 mph. A weather station at Aransas Pass – northeast of Corpus Christi and within storm’s eyewall, reported sustained winds up to 111 mph and gusts to 131 mph in the previous hour.

In addition to damaging winds, the National Hurricane Center . said.  it expects “catastrophic and life-threatening” flash flooding along the middle and upper Texas coast. An incredible amount of rain, 15 to 30 inches with isolated amounts of up to 40 inches, is predicted because . the storm is expected to stall.  and unload torrents for four to six straight days. In just a few days, the storm may dispense the amount of rain that normally falls over an entire year, shattering records..  . “Let’s set the expectations: Texas is about to have a very significant disaster,” said Brock Long, FEMA administrator..  .  .

The storm is also predicted to generate a devastating storm surge — or raise the water as much as 13 feet above normally dry land at the coast..  . “In all these years, it’s rare that I’ve seen a hurricane threat that concerns me as much as this one does,” . said Rick Knabb. , hurricane expert at the Weather Channel and former director of the National Hurricane Center..  . The National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi, near where the storm is expected to make landfall, . said.  that due to the combination of flooding from storm surge and rainfall, “locations may be uninhabitable for an extended period.” It warned of “structural damage to buildings, with many washing away” and that “streets and parking lots become rivers of raging water with underpasses submerged.”.  .  .

Areas along the middle and upper Texas coast may see 15 to 30 inches of rain, with a few areas receiving as much as 40 inches, although it is impossible to pinpoint exactly where the heaviest rain will fall..  . “Millions of people from Corpus Christi to Houston will get more than two feet of rain when all is done, with Southern Louisiana getting up to a foot of rain,” . said Louis Uccellini. , director of the National Weather Service..  .

August 25, 2017.  .  .  .  . Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city, could receive 20 inches or more of rain from the storm, depending on exactly where it tracks — with the heaviest moving in Saturday or Sunday and then continuing into early next week. Matt Lanza, a meteorologist based in Houston, said 20 inches would be “devastating” for the city, depending where it fell. A worst-case scenario, Lanza said, would be for this amount of rain to fall just northwest of downtown as “all that water has to push through the bayou networks across the city into Galveston Bay.”.  .  .

The Weather Channel’s Knabb pointed out 9 out of 10 people who die in landfalling tropical systems in the U.S. die in water, from either flooding from heavy rain or storm surge..  . “Promise yourself that you’re not going to drive your car over a water-covered roadway or drive your car around a barricade when the road is closed,” Knabb said. “Most people who die in inland flooding die in their cars.”.  . Especially late this weekend and into early next week, areas of western and southern Louisiana could also be hit with double-digit rainfall totals..  . Storm surge.  . The Hurricane Center predicts 6 to 13 feet of water — above normally dry land — inundating coastal areas immediately to the east and north of the landfall location. That amount is based on the assumption that Harvey makes landfall as a Category 3 hurricane. It is critical that affected residents heed evacuation orders..  .  .  [.

Keep in mind that the timing of normal astronomical tides is a factor. If the highest storm surge arrives at or near high tide, the total “storm tide” will be maximized..  .  .  .  . (NOAA).  .  . Compound effect of rain and storm surge.  . In coastal areas, the combination of double digit rainfall and a storm surge that raises water levels (above normally dry land) for days (because the storm will stall) may result in massive water buildup..  . “The collision of these ingredients looks like a train and car headed for an intersection on the tracks,” . writes Hal Needham, an international storm surge expert. . “If Galveston Bay is raised by several feet for many days, and a wide area of Texas real estate receives 15-20 or more inches of rain, where is that rain going to go? Runoff into Galveston Bay and Galveston Harbor will be severely impeded and this will create a catastrophic compound flood event.”.  . The area around Corpus Christi could face similar issues..  . Wind.  . Harvey was producing maximum sustained winds up to 130 mph when it came ashore, strong enough to cause widespread power outages and destruction to homes and businesses..  . At 11 p.m. Friday, tropical-storm-force winds expanded 140 miles away from the storm center, while hurricane-force-winds were confined within 40 miles of the center..  .

In addition to the violent straight-line winds inflicted by the storm, tornadoes could also spin up within its spiral bands as they push inland..  . Uncertainties.  . There are important uncertainties about storm’specific track and exactly how long it will linger in Texas. Both of these factors have significant implications for where the heaviest rain falls and how long the deluge persists..  . Right now, it is important for Texans in the path of this storm to understand — irrespective of where the storm makes landfall — Harvey’s footprint will be enormous because of the large expanse of its heavy rain field and long duration. Preparations should be brought to completion hastily..  . A note about what is considered a major hurricane.  . A major hurricane is technically defined as one rated Category 3 or higher on the 1-5 Saffir-Simpson intensity scale. The last major hurricane to make landfall on the United States was Wilma in October 2005. While Hurricane Ike in 2008 produced a devastating storm surge around Galveston and a massive economic toll, it was rated a high-end Category 2 storm at landfall. Superstorm Sandy, another devastating weather event, was no longer officially considered a hurricane when it made landfall near Atlantic City in 2012.

The ExxonMobil refinery in Baytown, Tex., in 2008. (Jessica Rinaldi/Reuters).  .  .  .  . ExxonMobil acknowledged Tuesday that Hurricane Harvey damaged two of its refineries, causing the release of hazardous pollutants..  . The acknowledgment, in a regulatory filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, follows repeated complaints on Twitter of an “unbearable” chemical smell over parts of Houston. However, it was not immediately clear what caused the smell..  . ExxonMobil said in the filings that a floating roof covering a tank at the company’s Baytown oil refinery sank in heavy rains, dipping below the surface of oil or other material stored there and causing unusually high emissions, especially of volatile organic compounds, a category of regulated chemicals..  .  .  [. Houston dam spills over while police say more than 3,500 rescued during Harvey flooding. ] .  .  . The Baytown refinery is the second-largest in the country. The company said in its filing that it would need to empty the tank to make repairs, though it wasn’t clear when the weather would permit that..  . An ExxonMobil spokeswoman said the company would “conduct an assessment to determine the impact of the storm once it is safe to do so.” It would not say what was in the tank..  . At the company’s Beaumont petrochemical refinery, Harvey damaged a sulfur thermal oxidizer, a piece of equipment that captures and burns sulfur dioxide. As a result, the plant released 1,312.84 pounds of sulfur dioxide, well in excess of the amounts allowed by the company’s permits..  . “The unit was stabilized. No impact to the community has been reported,” the company said in its filing. “Actions were taken to minimize emissions and to restore the refinery to normal operations.”.  . A variety of other chemicals was emitted during the shutdown of the plants. Amy Graham, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency, said that ExxonMobil had filed a report at the National Response Center operated by the U.S. Coast Guard saying the Baytown refinery would release about 15 pounds of benzene into the air..  . “Most of the unauthorized emissions come from the process of shutting down, and then starting up, the various units of the plant, when pollution control devices can’t be operated properly and there’s lots of flaring,” said Luke Metzger, director of the group Environment Texas..  . Flaring is generally done when releasing chemicals without burning them is more hazardous for people and the environment. ExxonMobil said it had flared hazardous materials at its Baytown refinery Sunday and Monday..  . Most of the other facilities belonging to major companies also filed notices with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Chevron Phillips, for example, said that it expected its Cedar Bayou chemical plant to exceed permitted limits for several hazardous pollutants, such as 1,3-butadiene, benzene and ethylene, during shutdown procedures..  . Environment Texas and the Sierra Club sued ExxonMobil in 2010 alleging that the company’s Baytown complex had emitted 8 million pounds of hazardous chemicals over a five-year period. A federal judge imposed a $20 million penalty on the company..  . “Any release of carcinogens (like benzene, 1,3-butadiene) adds to the increased cancer risk for those living near these plants,” Metzger said in an email. He said that large releases of nitrogen oxides or sulfur dioxide “and other respiratory irritants adds to the respiratory problems people in the area suffer from at high rates.”.  . Separately, the Houston Chronicle reported that there was a chemical leak from a pipeline that ruptured in La Porte, Texas on Monday. Local authorities urged residents to stay inside. The warning applied to people living as far away as Shoreacres and Baytown. The warning was later lifted..  . The Energy Department said that all six oil refineries in the Corpus Christi area, seven.  . oil refineries in the Houston and Galveston area, and one refinery in the Beaumont/Port Arthur area were shut down or in the process of shutting down. The idle refineries have a capacity of 3.2 million barrels a day, equal to a third of Gulf coast capacity and 17.6 percent of total U.S. refining capacity. Further closures are likely as the storm moves east into Louisiana, where there is another 1.65 million barrels a day of oil refining capacity..  .  . The logjam of tankers and trucks was adding to woes. Valero, which had closed its two refineries in the Corpus Christi area, said it was looking to reopen the facilities but that damaged pipeline, port and transportation infrastructure could delay re-openings..  .  . Bloomberg News reported that Marathon said it was closing its Galveston Bay refinery because it was running out of crude, which could not be delivered because of port closures..  .  . Gasoline prices for September delivery also rose amid signs that the Gulf’s woes could spread. The Colonial Pipeline, the main link between the heart of the nation’s oil and gas industry and consumers in the northeast, said that supplies of refined petroleum products from the Houston area had been disrupted..  .  .

The city of Houston, the Environmental Protection Agency and an environmental advocacy group are investigating a potentially hazardous plume of a carcinogenic substance in one neighborhood after a nearby oil refiner reported its operations suffered hurricane-related damage..  . The city and the Environmental Defense Fund said extra air monitors they dispatched to Houston’s Manchester region on Monday detected the presence of benzene, a component of crude oil and gasoline..  . Two monitors detected significantly different levels of the carcinogen at different times of the day, and additional sampling is needed to determine the concentration, according to Loren Raun, chief environmental science officer for the Houston Health Department, and Elena Craft, a senior health scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, which became involved in the probe after offering the city assistance..  . A . . . . . .             . Valero Energy Partners. .             . .        LP refinery in the neighborhood reported a hurricane-related leak on Aug. 27..  . The EPA said it was deploying an air monitor to the area on Tuesday to help the investigation. Officials are seeking to pinpoint the source of the benzene plume, the concentration and how far-reaching the emissions may have spread, Ms. Raun said Tuesday morning, after a call with EPA, EDF and Houston city officials.. . . . . . . . . . . .

A Manchester oil refinery that is a subsidiary of Valero Energy Partners said the leak on Aug. 27 resulted in the emission of benzene and other hazardous compounds, according to a copy of the refiner’s report to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or TCEQ..  . The report, which was filed through the State of Texas Environmental Electronic Reporting System and is available on TCEQ’s website, said the leak was a result of “heavy rainfall complications,” and that cleanup was under way..  . . . Valero Energy. . .  Corp.. . .        is the majority owner of Valero Energy Partners. In an Aug. 29 statement on its website, Valero Energy Corp. said Harvey’s pounding rainfall sank the floating roof of a crude-oil tank, leading to an oil leak..  . The statement said the company’s air-quality monitoring found “no detectable levels of emissions in the community.”  Valero said it didn’t have an immediate update on Tuesday.. . . . . . .

Companies must report emissions that exceed permitted amounts, a TCEQ spokesman said, adding that the state “investigates all emissions events that are reported to the agency.”.  . Houston Health Department investigators who visited the Valero refinery Tuesday found low traces of hazardous compounds using a hand-held air monitor, which is used to identify whether compounds are present, but doesn’t identify specific compounds, Ms. Raun said. Investigators didn’t detect hazardous emissions from the damaged tank Tuesday using an infared camera. “That’s good news,” she said..  . Valero’s disclosure to the TCEQ was one of 56 preliminary emissions reports citing Hurricane Harvey that the state commission received from petroleum and chemical companies as of Aug. 31, according to an analysis of TCEQ filings by the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group based in Tucson, Ariz..  . Those Harvey-related emissions released nearly 1 million pounds of seven toxic compounds, including benzene, the group reported..  . TCEQ declined to comment on the nonprofit’s Harvey-related analysis..  . In 2016, petroleum, chemical and polymer companies reported 3,289 emission events to the TCEQ, excluding events that were scheduled or involved excess capacity, commission data show. Those 2016 events released 56 million pounds of materials, the data show..  . The majority of the Harvey-related reports involved hazardous emissions triggered by the shutdown of operations as the storm approached, said Shaye Wolf, an ecologist and climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity. Such shutdowns can cause emissions that escape via a mechanism known as a flare, which relieves pressure that builds up when operations cease quickly, she said..  . Other Harvey-related emissions reports, including Valero’s disclosure, involved storm damage to tanks, boilers, and power systems that led to hazardous emissions, according to report data available on TCEQ’s site..  . Public health officials worry when those pollutants concentrate at ground level, instead of soaring into the atmosphere or being diluted and dispersed by strong winds, said Michael Honeycutt, director of the TCEQ toxicology division..  . One of Houston’s permanent air monitors in the vicinity of the Manchester neighborhood is still disabled after it was flooded during Hurricane Harvey, according to TCEQ. Texas has two additional air-monitoring stations to the north and one to the south of the flood-disabled monitor, a TCEQ spokesman said. Those have been back online and working since Sept. 1, after the state temporarily shut down its entire air-monitoring system before the hurricane hit to prevent damage, he said..  . Roughly 80% of state air-monitoring stations in Houston, Corpus Christi and Beaumont were back up and running Monday, said Cory Chism, who oversees air monitoring for the TCEQ. As the air-monitoring network came back online, the state began receiving pollution data again late on Aug. 31. “Nothing we have seen thus far in the data has been out of the ordinary,” Mr. Chism said of the working monitors..  .  .

Courtney Sacco/Corpus Christi Caller-Times, via Associated Press        . . . . . . . . . How much does Hurricane Harvey, or any particular storm, have to do with . climate change. ?. The relationship between hurricanes and climate change is not simple. Some things are known with growing certainty. Others, not so much.. The.  most recent draft.  of.  a sweeping climate science.  report pulled together by 13 federal agencies as part of the National Climate Assessment suggested that the science linking hurricanes to climate change was still emerging. Looking back through the history of storms, “the trend signal has not yet had time to rise above the background variability of natural processes,” the report states.. Temperatures have been rising, and theory and computer modeling suggest an increase in storm intensity in a warmer world, “and the models generally show an increase in the number of very intense” storms.. And while the science of attributing weather events to climate change is advancing, “studies of individual events will typically contain caveats,” the report stated.. . . Video. . . . .

Katharine Hayhoe. , a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and an author of the report, said even if global warming does not change the number of storms — and, she noted, there could even be fewer hurricanes over all — tropical storms and hurricanes do gain energy from warm water, so the unusually warm water that has accompanied climate change “can have a role in intensifying a storm that already exists.”. . . . .

More moisture in the atmosphere, she said, means the amount and intensity of rain associated with hurricanes and other storms is growing. While people might think of high winds and storm surge as the risks of hurricanes, she said, “freshwater flooding is potentially a much greater problem than the storm surge.”.  .

That does not mean storm surge is any less a threat than before..  Andrew Dessler. , a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, said that the most solid link between climate change and storms is that “storm surge is made worse by sea level rise, which we are certain humans have contributed to.”. Dr. Hayhoe noted that scientists are not saying that hurricanes are necessarily caused by climate change, but are being affected by them.. “We care about a changing climate because it exacerbates the natural risks and hazards that we already face,” she said. “People always want to know is it climate change or is it not? The answer is it’s in between.”.  . Continue reading the main story. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We’re interested in your feedback on this page. .

Prison inmates in Rosharon, Tex., were evacuated by bus on Saturday before expected flooding in the area.. . . . . Credit. .             Texas Department of Criminal Justice        . . . . . . . . . Thousands of inmates were being evacuated on Saturday from three prison facilities in Rosharon, Tex., as the Brazos River there continued to rise under heavy rains from . Tropical Storm Harvey. .. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice said that about 4,500 inmates would be transported from the Ramsey, Terrell and Stringfellow units in Rosharon, which is just south of Houston, to other facilities in East Texas.. The prisoners were being transported by bus and accompanied by correctional officers and other staff.. “We’re doing everything we can to make sure everybody’s safe while the evacuation process is being carried out,” said Robert Hurst, a public information officer with the criminal justice department.. He did not say where the prisoners would be taken, or how long the evacuation process might last.. While away from Rosharon, the prisoners will “not be available for visits at the designated receiving units, but will have the ability to use the offender telephone system,” the .  criminal justice department.  said.. Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas as . a Category 4 hurricane on Friday night. . It was downgraded to a tropical storm on Saturday, but . heavy rains and serious flooding are expected in the state’s southeast. .. By Friday, the criminal justice department had canceled visitations for at least 29 prisons in the vicinity of the storm’s expected path. “This is something that we prepare for each year. Our command center is operating around the clock and we stand ready,” Bryan Collier, executive director of the department, said in a . statement on Facebook. .. . . Newsletter Sign Up. . .

By noon, the Brazos River near Rosharon had already risen by at least 15 feet since Friday, according to data from the National Weather Service.. The three facilities were also evacuated in May and June of last year, when the same river flooded under heavy rainfall. Prisoners were returned there after a couple of weeks.. The three all-male prisons do not house any death row inmates. . Public records.  show that among the inmates are Shawn Allen Berry, one of three men convicted in the racially motivated killing of James Byrd Jr., a black man who was dragged behind a car in 1998; and David Owen Brooks, who was convicted as an accomplice to Dean Corll, the perpetrator of the so-called Houston mass murders of the early 1970s..  .

He gave an example that someone seeing a “skinny black line” showing the hurricane’s path over Corpus Christi, but who doesn’t live immediately in the city and thinks the storm wouldn’t affect them, would be wrong. . . .

The city of Houston was at a standstill as I-45 north of downtown became a river after tropical storm Allison dumped 28 inches of rain in 24 hours. The storm prompted Texas Gov. Rick Perry to declare a state of emergency in Harris and 28 other southeast Texas counties. (Richard Carson/Reuters).  .  . Texas is frantically preparing for what in all likelihood will be the . most devastating storm in over a decade. . Forecasters are saying soon-to-be Hurricane Harvey will be a slow-motion disaster — reaching the coast as a major hurricane on Friday and lingering over the same location through the weekend..  . Residents of Southeast Texas — not just those along the coast — should be preparing and stocking up on food, water and other essentials. This hurricane’s biggest threat looks likely to be extreme rainfall and flooding, which will occur well away from the coast..  . According to the National Weather Service, 59 percent of all tropical cyclone-related deaths in the United States since 1970 have been caused by freshwater flooding, whereas only 12 percent can be attributed to wind. If nothing else, this illustrates the urgency with which residents must heed all forecasts and evacuation orders..  .  .  [. Hurricane Harvey forecast to slam East Texas as first major hurricane in U.S. since 2005. ] .  .  . We can look back on previous storms for an idea of what eastern Texas may be forced to endure in the coming days, but there’s one that stands out in Texas weather history: Tropical Storm Allison..  . Allison was never a hurricane, it was “just” a tropical storm with a lot of water trapped inside. As it neared the Texas/Louisiana coastline on June 5-6, 2001, nearly 10 inches of rain fell in five hours across southwest Louisiana, alerting forecasters to potential trouble when the system struck Houston..  . Clear skies and moisture streaming inland from the Gulf set the stage for significant flash flooding on June 8-9, and widespread thunderstorms dropped over a foot of rain by sunrise on June 10..  . Unfortunately, the majority of Allison’s rain fell over the populous Houston metro area. According to the National Weather Service’s post-storm Service Assessment, “two-thirds of Harris County (Houston) received over 10 inches of rain.” . Isolated spots in northeastern Houston racked up more than 20 inches of rain..  . More than . 45,000 homes and 70,000 vehicles fell victim to the floods. , while inundations in the Texas Medical Center led to the loss of decades’ worth of medical research..  . Meanwhile, the 22 deaths that resulted from the deluge offer some insight as to what not to do during a flood situation. . Nearly half of all the deaths occurred in automobiles. . If you cannot see the road beneath floodwaters, then turn around. Just a few inches of rapidly-moving water can sweep your vehicle off the road, and oftentimes the water may be deeper than one would think..  . Several deaths were also caused by electrocution. . For the same reason we wouldn’t use a toaster while taking a bath, avoid entering floodwaters at all costs. Oftentimes, utility poles and live wires may be submerged — acting as giant toasters in a neighborhood-sized bathtub..  . Allison’s winds never exceeded 70 miles per hour, but the $10 billion in damage and biblical flooding prove that a storm doesn’t have to be a hurricane to be a catastrophe..  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

President visits Corpus Christi to meet with Texas officials. . . . . . . . . . . Waving the Texas flag, President Trump vowed Tuesday to help storm-stricken residents get back on their feet as he surveyed the damage on the ground from Hurricane Harvey and predicted a recovery effort "better than ever before.". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The president's trip to Texas Tuesday was mostly dedicated to meetings with local officials and emergency responders. . . . But, stepping outside a Corpus Christi fire station, he paused from the formal briefings to try and boost the spirits of Texans who have spent days salvaging their belongings, searching for loved ones and getting to dry land while they wait out the flood. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . President Donald Trump holds a flag of the state of Texas after receiving a briefing on Tropical Storm Harvey relief efforts at a local fire station where local residents gathered to welcome the president in Corpus Christi, Texas, U.S., August 29, 2017. .       .         . (REUTERS/Carlos Barria). . . . . . . . . Standing between two fire trucks, Trump told a crowd that had gathered outside, "We are here to take care of you." . . . "We're going to get you back and operating immediately," Trump said, before holding up a large Texas state flag. . . . At that same fire station, Trump was briefed moments earlier on relief efforts alongside Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and FEMA Administrator Brock Long.. . . . . . . . . “We want to do it better than ever before,” Trump said of the recovery. “We want to be looked at in five years or ten years from now as this is the way to do it.”. . . Speaking of the storm, the president said: “This was of epic proportion. Nobody has ever seen anything like this.”. . . The president, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, arrived at Corpus Christi International Airport shortly before noon local time. He was greeted by Abbott.. . . “We want him to see and understand the enormous challenges that Texans have faced and the need for the aid that he’s providing," Abbott told reporters as the president's plane landed. . . . On Tuesday afternoon, the president left Corpus Christi and flew to Austin, where he visited the Texas Department of Safety Emergency Operations Center and praised the work of its employees.. . . "The world is watching and the world is really impressed with what you are doing," Trump said.. . . Speaking with state officials, the president said he’d be “working with Congress” on relief funds but acknowledged it would be a “costly proposition.". . . "There's probably never been something so expensive in our country's history," Trump said.. . . The president was also joined by Texas Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn.. . . Abbott, a Republican, commended Trump for his response to the storm.. . . "Behind the scenes, the president has shown character and compassion," Abbott said. "He helped get Texas prepared.".  . . . Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during the flight to Texas, Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the intention of Tuesday’s trip was to "lay the foundation for what we know will be a long recovery effort.”. . . Corpus Christi is more than three hours away from Houston, where parts of the city are still under water, but Sanders said the president is keeping his distance from the devastation at this time so he doesn’t interrupt local recovery efforts.. . . "The president wants to be very cautious about making sure that any activity doesn't disrupt the recovery efforts that are still ongoing," she said.. . . Some Cabinet members joined the president for the trip, including Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon.. . . The Cabinet officials met separately with their counterparts in state government during the visit, Sanders said.. . . The president returns to Washington on Tuesday evening but is expected to travel again to Texas this weekend, Sanders said.. . . During a press conference at the White House on Monday, the president promised “very rapid action from Congress, certainly from the president” on approving disaster funding for Texas.. . . TRUMP VOWS '100 PERCENT' SUPPORT, RAPID FEDERAL AID TO HARVEY VICTIMS. . . “We expect to have requests on our desk fairly soon, and we think that Congress will feel very much the way I feel,” Trump said. “In a very bipartisan way. That will be nice. But we think you're going to have what you need and it's going to go fast.”. . . Trump dismissed the notion that emergency funding for Texas could complicate efforts as a spending bill is negotiated with Congress.. . . “I think it has nothing to do with it, really,” he said. “I think this is separate.”. . . Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign committee on Tuesday asked Americans to donate to relief funds, including the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the United Way, the SPCA and the Humane Society.. . . “This is a time to come together as a nation to support those in need in the wake of this disaster and the unprecedented flooding they are experiencing in the greater Houston and coastal Texas region,” Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law and a senior advisor to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., said in a news release.. . . Vice President Mike Pence said during an interview on a Corpus Christi radio program Tuesday that he also plans to take a trip to Texas this week.. . . “My wife and I will be in southeast Texas later this week, and we're going to continue to provide all of the resources necessary to advance the efforts to rescue people that are enduring this storm,” he said.. . .

Storm surge can be the deadliest effect of a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center is attempting to mitigate this risk by issuing storm surge watches and warnings. (NOAA).  .  . With a major hurricane poised near the Texas coastline and expected to stall for several days, it’s essentially a worst case-scenario for beachside communities in the path of Hurricane Harvey. While destructive winds and nearly unprecedented rainfall amounts will lash the Gulf Coast, a devastating storm surge will roar ashore Friday into Saturday, raising the sea as much as 12 feet above normally dry land..  . Because Harvey is forecast to stall, storm surge inundation may persist for several days in the hardest-hit areas, flooding roads, homes and businesses, and making it difficult to return to them..  . The National Weather Service has launched the first-ever issuance of their new product, the Storm Surge Warning. A rendition of what was previously the Coastal Flood Warning, this alert is reserved only for cases when “the danger of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland” will pose a serious threat to local residents..  .  .  .  . (National Hurricane Center).  .  . A storm surge is not a wave of water but, rather, the gradual rise of sea levels because of water blown by the storm and an upward tidal bulge resulting from the storm’s exceptionally low pressure. All said, the ocean may tower 10 or more feet above normal, racking the coastline and sweeping away structures caught in harm’s way..  . The National Weather Service in Corpus Christi, Tex., is calling for “extreme storm surge flooding greater than 9 feet above ground” and advises that residents “aggressively prepare for catastrophic flooding impacts.”.  .  .  . Here's what storm surge could look like in Corpus Christi . https://t.co/2ct8VADj8p.  . pic.twitter.com/lnIuoglHfj.  . — Meteorology Meg (@MeteorologyMeg) . August 25, 2017.  .  .  .  . It should be noted that, because of wind direction, duration and local topography, the maximum levels of inundation at a location do not necessarily correspond to the intensity of the wind/rainfall. Instead, the most devastating impacts will be felt on the north side of the storm, particularly Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and Matagorda Bay toward Freeport and Lake Jackson. Communities on either side of this stretch will still experience moderate to major storm surge flooding..  . Especially at risk will be Port Lavaca, Port O’Connor and Seadrift, which can anticipate a staggering rise of eight to 12 feet. Bayside, Refugio and Woodsboro are next in line for top-end inundation. This will be potentially deadly to anyone caught in the danger zone, so now is the time to prepare. This may mean abandoning property and simply fleeing as quickly as possible to a place of safety..  . Sheltering from the wind is easy; hiding from water is impossible for those within 12 feet of sea level. Keep in mind that there is nothing to hold back the water from racing as much as a mile or more inland; to reiterate, a storm surge is not a series of waves that will recede but, instead, can be visualized as the ocean simply being 12 feet higher than it typically is. The vast majority of hurricane deaths occur because of flooding; now is not the time to be brave, because you don’t want to become a statistic on the 11 o’clock news after the storm; get out. Poor decisions may cost you your life..  . Elsewhere, Corpus Christi, Port Aransas and Robstown will see a 4-to-7-foot surge. Lesser amounts, on the order of a few feet, will be found toward Baffin Bay, Malaquite Beach and Kingsville. Toward Galveston and Houston, meanwhile, the official forecast calls for 5 to 8 feet; however, it could be 1 to 2 feet higher. This is because of the prolonged onshore winds and storm surge precluding excessive rainfall from draining into the ocean, resulting in exacerbated flooding issues around the time of high tides. This is problem known as compound flooding..  . Past hurricanes in Texas, such as Ike in 2008, have wrought havoc with their storm surge flooding, and Harvey will be no exception..  . Residents along the immediate shoreline should wrap up preparations..  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

With Hurricane Irma bearing down on the Caribbean and the southern United States, meteorologist Adam Klotz explains the impact of a category 5 storm. . . . . . . . . . . Florida is preparing for potential damage from Hurricane Irma as the Category 4 storm continues its path toward the state. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . "The storm is bigger, faster and stronger than Hurricane Andrew," Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Wednesday, referring to . the devastating Category 5 storm that made landfall over the southern part of the state in 1992. . On Monday, Scott declared a state of emergency for Florida.. . . "Do not focus on the exact path of this storm," he said. "A storm of this size could have effects statewide and everyone must be prepared.". . . . . Hurricane Irma is located about 450 miles southeast of Miami, and about 80 miles northeast of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center said . Friday morning. ..  . . . The storm is headed west-northwest at 16 mph with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph and is currently moving between the central Bahamas and the north coast of Cuba.. . . . . The storm was increasingly likely to rip into heavily populated South Florida early Sunday, prompting officials to impose mandatory evacuation orders for parts of the Miami metro area and the Florida Keys.. . . . . . . . . Forecasters said Irma could punish the entire Atlantic coast of Florida and rage on into Georgia and South Carolina. The Keys and parts of South Florida were placed under a hurricane watch Thursday.. . . Hurricanes are categorized using what’s known as the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.. . . Below is a look at each of the five categories in the scale and what the ratings mean.. . . Category 1, sustained winds of 74 - 95 mph. . . For storms in this category, there’s going to be “some damage” from winds, the . National Hurricane Center (NHC).  says.. . . Large tree branches and shallow trees could be knocked down, according to the agency. Gutters, roofs, shingles and vinyl siding for what it calls “well-constructed frame homes” could be affected, as well. . . . Category 2, sustained winds of 96 - 110 mph. . . “Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage,” the NHC warns for such storms.. . . There may be power outages “that could last from several days to weeks,” as well as major damage to roofs and home sidings, the agency says. . . . Category 3, sustained winds of 111 - 129 mph. . . Category 3, Category 4 and Category 5 storms are all labeled “major” hurricanes.. . . With Category 3, there will be “devastating” damage, according to the NHC.. . . “Well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends,” it warns. There also will be no water or electricity for days to weeks after the storm moves along, it says.. . . Category 4, sustained winds of 130 - 156 mph. . . For both Category 4 and Category 5 storms, “catastrophic” damage is forecast. They can see residential areas isolated by trees and power poles that have come down. Power outages can last weeks and months, the agency says.. . . Category 5, sustained winds of 157 mph or above. . . This is the highest rating for hurricanes in the scale. “A high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse,” according to the NHC.. . .

Residents of the Gulf Coast hunkered down late Friday amid dire warnings of a major natural disaster as Hurricane Harvey, having intensified rapidly into a Category 4 storm with 130 mph winds, roared ashore just to the northeast of this South Texas city..  . The National Hurricane Center reported at 10 p.m. CDT that the center of the eye of the cyclone had just crossed the Texas shoreline over the northern end of a barrier island about four miles east of the city of Rockport. Initial reports compiled by the National Weather Service said numerous structures in Rockport had been “destroyed” and described “buildings collapsed with people trapped inside.” These early reports, distributed on social media, remained sketchy as the storm raged into the middle of the night..  . Here in Corpus Christi, a city of 320,000 people, lights flickered downtown, where many locals, out-of-town journalists and storm chasers had taken refuge in hotels. Local media reported roofs blown off homes..  . The most intense winds appeared to stay just offshore as the hurricane crept northward, likely driving the worst of the storm surge flooding into the central Texas coast. City officials cautioned that the hurricane was expected to pound the city until well past midnight..  . Harvey is easily the strongest hurricane to hit the United States since Charley in 2004 and the first Category 3 or greater storm (winds of 111 mph or higher) since Wilma in 2005. Forecasters and government officials, scrambling to deal with a storm that popped up this week after being a mere tropical depression in the western Gulf of Mexico, warned of . catastrophic flooding. , ferocious winds and a storm surge that could reach 12 feet..  .  .  . Waves crash against the coast as Hurricane Harvey intensifies in the Gulf of Mexico in Port Lavaca, Tex., on Aug. 25, 2017. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post).  .  . Soon after the outer bands of Harvey reached the South Texas coast, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) on Friday afternoon urged citizens to evacuate low-lying and coastal areas immediately. President Trump said Friday night that he has signed a . disaster proclamation.  in Texas after Abbott sent him a written request..  . “The storm surge, coupled with the deluge of rain, could easily lead to billions of dollars of property damage and almost certainly loss of life,” Abbott wrote. “It is not hyperbole to say that if the forecast verifies, Texas is about to experience one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the state.”.  . White House aides said that Trump would visit Texas next week..  .  . [. Complete coverage: Hurricane Harvey. ].  .  . Harvey is the first natural disaster faced by the Trump administration. Trump on Friday tweeted that he had spoken with the governors of Texas and Louisiana and was “here to assist as needed.”.  . Sen. Charles E. Grassley ­(R-Iowa) gave the president a warning via Twitter: “keep on top of hurricane Harvey dont mke same mistake Pres Bush made w Katrina.”.  . Here in Corpus Christi, city and county officials said they are ready for the worst..  .  .  .  .  . Capital Weather Gang's Jason Samenow breaks down the three main threats from Harvey: Torrential downpours, a storm surge and heavy winds. (Claritza Jimenez,Jason Samenow/The Washington Post).  .  .  . “Game on,” said Mayor Joe McComb at a news conference. “We’re looking forward to having a very good positive result from this storm. We’ll get through this; we’ll be better for it because the community has been pulling together.”.  . But many residents were nervous as the storm approached Friday..  . In nearby Aransas Pass, 66-year-old Mike Taylor said he was resigned to riding out the storm in his one-story house just a few blocks from the water. As part of routine hurricane preparations, the town maintains a list of residents who need help in leaving. Taylor, who does not own a car and lives with his disabled 40-year-old son, said he thought he was on the list..  . No one came for him..  . “Now, I am just out trying to find some groceries,” said Taylor, who was trudging along Route 35 in a yellow raincoat, even though all the grocery and convenience stores appeared closed. “I lost my driver’s license because I am nearly blind.”.  . Several hundred miles of the Texas Gulf Coast are under hurricane and storm-surge warnings. Harvey is expected to stall over the coast and could even drift back out over open water, drawing fresh energy from the warm gulf waters before meandering ashore again closer to Galveston..  . That scenario would deliver historic amounts of rain to the region, with some models showing accumulations in feet rather than inches. Flooding is likely in and around Houston..  . “Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become raging rivers. Flood control systems and barriers may become stressed,” the . National Weather Service said.  in an advisory Friday..  .  . [. How to prepare for Hurricane Harvey — whether you evacuate or not. ].  .  . Thousands of people were reportedly stuck on cruise ships in the gulf and unable to enter the closed Port of Galveston as the winds picked up..  . Jennifer Cantrell, 37, a Houston social worker who endured Hurricane Ike in 2008, bought four 40-pound bags of topsoil to place at the foot of her door in her first-floor apartment..  . “We got to worry about all the folks who moved here in the last years and haven’t seen a hurricane yet,” she said outside a Citgo gas station, where she had stopped to stock up on cigarettes. “You’ve just got to be prepared to be indoors for days with no electricity, no water.”.  . The Texas Military Department deployed about 700 members of the State Guard and National Guard around the coastal region on Friday as the storm moved in. Black Hawk and Lakota helicopter crews were put on standby for search and rescue..  . The American Red Cross mobilized staffers from across the country. Paul I. Carden Jr., regional disaster officer for the Red Cross’s National Capital Region in Washington, said in Corpus Christi that residents are foolish if they decide not to evacuate..  . After the storm, the Red Cross will be providing cleanup kits, health and mental-health professionals, and spiritual-care workers to help residents cope, he said..  . “This is going to try a person’s faith,” Carden said..  . A steady and orderly stream of traffic flowed out of Corpus Christi, heading for higher ground. But many thousands decided to ride out the storm..  . Friday morning, residents Phyllis Sweeney and Gary Balding told their story of fleeing the wrath of tropical storms. They live on a 41-foot sailboat, having moved to Corpus Christi from Key West. Two weeks ago, they tried to sail to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico but were battered by . Hurricane Franklin. ..  . “We got within 20 miles, and couldn’t get there because the winds and currents were blowing in the wrong direction,” said Balding, 68. “We thought, ‘Okay, we’ll go to Corpus Christi, and everything will be cool.’ ”.  . Now they’re in the path of Harvey. They fled the boat early Friday and checked into the Holiday Inn downtown. The hotel has become a refuge for stranded tourists, boaters, storm chasers and journalists. But Sweeney, 70, is worried about the hotel, which is surrounded by skyscrapers..  . In the ranching town of Kingsville, about 40 miles southwest of Corpus Christi, Nick Harrel III, 65, who runs Harrel’s Pharmacy and Soda Fountain, said he has weathered many hurricanes and is going to ride this one out..  . “After the initial fear, you just take a deep breath and do what you can to prepare,” he said. “I have storm shutters that fit my windows, and I bought a generator last year. I am coming late to being a Boy Scout.”.  . Silver Marquez, 34, went from table to table at the crowded El Tapatio taqueria in Kingsville, selling pan de campo, a flatbread traditionally cooked in Dutch ovens at cattle camps in South Texas..  . “I have plain, bacon and cheese and jalapeño,” said Marquez, a Kingsville native. “They are fresh and hot, and I am selling a lot of them because people are stocking up for the hurricane.”.  . Santos Rojas, 72, said he isn’t preparing for the hurricane much beyond buying bottled water and pan de campo..  . At the small rural shrine to Don Pedrito Jaramillo, a revered Mexican American folk saint who died in 1907, believers filed in to ask for protection from the storm. Jaramillo, a native of Guadalajara, Mexico, had a reputation for healing in a time and place where few people had access to conventional medical care..  . Aurora Zapata, 42, a homemaker, and her daughter, Dina Zapata, 12, both of Falfurrias, were lighting candles at the shrine Friday afternoon as the first bands of rain began to make landfall..  . “We are just praying to Don Pedrito to protect us, our whole family and our town from this hurricane,” Aurora Zapata said..  . Her daughter agreed. “There is nothing we can do to fight the storm, but we all know that God and the Virgin and Don Pedrito are always there for us.”.  .  . Grant reported from Kingsville, Tex. Achenbach reported from Washington. Dylan Baddour in Houston, Ashley Cusick in New Orleans, and Mark Berman, Steven Mufson and Jason Samenow in Washington contributed to this report..  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

Atlantic Basin.  .  . . . . . Remember tropical storm Harvey? It made its way across the open Atlantic as a tropical wave and became a tropical storm just before reaching the Windward Islands a few days ago – bringing flooding rains to Barbados especially. Then, it died away, almost.. . . The low level energy associated with Harvey has remained very much intact and is now over the Yucatan peninsula, poised to emerge in to the Bay of Campeche later tonight. From there, computer models strongly suggest that it will strengthen and perhaps to hurricane intensity. This is concerning since it will be doing so while moving towards land, possibly Texas and/or northeast Mexico. The time frame from it becoming a depression again to hurricane strength may be short and people along the coast may not realize what’s coming.. . . I have produced a video discussion covering this topic plus a look at 92L (which is not likely to do very much in the coming days). Check out the video below and note that I will have another one posted early this afternoon:. . . . . M. Sudduth 10:15 AM ET Aug 22. . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . .

Imagine a hurricane, a hurricane like Matthew, aimed straight at the heart of the American petrochemical industry. . Isaiah whirls through the sky, gathering strength from the Gulf of Mexico’s warm waters. Beach towns are evacuated. Citizens and companies in Texas’ petro-industrial enclaves from Bayou Vista to Morgan’s Point are warned: Prepare for the worst.. The huge cyclone gathers strength as it nears the barrier islands off the coast, intensifying to Category 4. Hours before landfall, 150 mile-per-hour winds begin pushing water over the Galveston Seawall, and by the time the eye finally hits, Galveston has been flattened by a 20-foot wave.. Isaiah’s monstrous arm reaches across the bay toward Houston, some 50 miles inland, adding water to water, and when it smashes into the Exxon Mobil Baytown refinery, the storm surge is over 25 feet high. It crashes through refineries, chemical storage facilities, wharves and production plants all along the Houston Ship Channel, cleaving pipelines from their moorings, lifting and breaking storage tanks.. . . . . Advertisement. . . . . Continue reading the main story. . . . . As Isaiah passes inland, the iridescent, gray-brown flood rises, carrying jet fuel, sour crude and natural gas liquids into strip malls, parks, schools and offices. More than 200 petrochemical storage tanks have been wrecked, more than 100 million gallons of petroleum and chemicals spilled. Damages for the region are estimated at more than $100 billion. More than 3,500 are dead. It is one of the worst disasters in United States history: worse than the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, worse than Hurricane Katrina, worse than the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11..  . Continue reading the main story. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Advertisement. . . . . Continue reading the main story. . . . . . . . . . . . . The good news is that Isaiah hasn’t happened. It’s an imaginary calamity based on research and models. The bad news is that it’s only a matter of time before it does.. Any 50-mile stretch of the Texas coast can expect a hurricane once every six years on average, according to the National Weather Service. Only a few American cities are more vulnerable to hurricanes than Houston and Galveston, and not one of those is as crucial to the economy.. When the next big storm hits there, the effects will ripple across the globe. The Gulf Coast is home to roughly 30 percent of the United States’s proven oil reserves; The Gulf Coast and Texas hold 35 percent of its natural gas reserves. The refineries and plants encircling Galveston Bay are responsible for roughly 25 percent of the United States’s petroleum refining, more than 44 percent of its ethylene production, 40 percent of its specialty chemical feed stock and more than half of its jet fuel.. Houston is the second busiest port in the United States in terms of pure tonnage and one of the most important shipping points in the country for natural gas liquids. A hurricane like Isaiah would shut all that down.. There’s more: Future hurricanes will actually be worse than Isaiah. The models Isaiah is based on, developed by Rice University’s Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation From Disaster (Sspeed) Center, don’t account for climate change. According to Jim Blackburn, Sspeed’s co-director, other models have shown much more alarming surges. “The City of Houston and FEMA did a climate change future,” he told me, “and the surge in that scenario was 34 feet. Hurricanes are going to get bigger. No question. They are fueled by the heat of the ocean, and the ocean’s warming. Our models are nowhere close.”. I took a tour on the M/V Sam Houston to see the Houston Ship Channel, the densest energy infrastructure nexus in the United States. The boat slipped from the pier and spun east. Across the brown-black water, giant cranes shifted scrap from one heap to another with magnets and claws, throwing up clouds of metal.. Several industrial recycling companies line the upper reaches of the channel, all recognized emitters of one of the most potent carcinogens known to science, hexavalent chromium. Behind the cranes lies the predominantly Hispanic neighborhood of Magnolia Park, whose residents have long complained of mysterious gas emissions, persistent pollution and strange, multicolored explosions. I thought of the models Mr. Blackburn had shown me, imagining a wave of water sweeping toxic waste into playgrounds, shops and houses.. . . . . Advertisement. . . . . Continue reading the main story. . . . . The tour boat’s engines thrummed beneath my feet. In the distance, gas flares flashed against the cloud cover.. A voice boomed from the boat: “First refinery to the right, this is Valero. This refinery began operations in 1942. It will handle 145,000 barrels of oil per day.” Directly behind Valero lies Hartman Park, with its green lawns and baseball diamonds — the jewel of Manchester, one of the most polluted neighborhoods in the United States. Manchester is bordered on the north by Valero, and on the east, south and west by a chemical plant, a car-crushing yard, a water-treatment plant, a train yard, Interstate 610 and a Goodyear synthetic rubber plant. In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency found toxic levels of seven different carcinogens in the neighborhood.. Our tour boat was out and back in 90 minutes, but the Houston Ship Channel keeps going for miles. Rounding the San Jacinto Battleground, it bends south, cutting a trench approximately 530 feet wide and 45 feet deep through Galveston Bay all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. As you follow the channel south on I-45, strip clubs and fast-food franchises give way to bayou resorts and refineries. I-45 ends in downtown Galveston, once known as the “Wall Street of the South”: a mix of historic homes, dry-docked oil rigs, beach bars and the University of Texas Medical Branch. The gulf spreads sullen and muddy to the horizon, its placid skin broken by distant blisters of flaming steel.. Galveston Bay is a Texas paradox. One of the most productive estuaries in the United States, it offers up huge catches of shrimp, blue crab, oysters, croaker, flounder and catfish, and supports dozens of other kinds of fish, turtles, dolphins, salamanders, sharks and snakes, as well as hundreds of species of birds. Yet the bay is heavily polluted, so full of P.C.B.s, pesticides, dioxin and petrochemicals that fishing is widely restricted..  . Continue reading the main story. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Photo. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Oil and water surrounded a pump jack Sept. 14, 2008, in High Island, Tex. after Hurricane Ike made landfall.. . . . . Credit. .             Pool photo by Smiley N. Pool, via Getty Images        . . . . . . . . . . . . . The bay is Houston’s shield, protecting it from the worst of the Gulf Coast’s weather by absorbing storm surges and soaking up rainfall, but hydrologists at Rice University are worried it might also be Houston’s doom: The wide, shallow basin could, under the right conditions, supercharge a storm surge right up the ship channel.. The fight to protect Houston and Galveston from storms has been going on for more than a century, ever since Galveston built a 17-foot sea wall after the Great Storm of 1900, a Category 4 hurricane that killed an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 people. The fight has been mainly reactive, always planning for the last big storm, rarely for the next. The levees around Texas City, for instance, were built after Hurricane Carla submerged the chemical plants there in 10 feet of water in 1961. Today, Hurricane Ike, which hit Texas in 2008, offers the object lesson.. Hurricane Ike was a lucky hit with unlucky timing. Forecasts had the hurricane landing at the southern end of Galveston Island, and if they’d been right, Ike would have looked a lot like Isaiah. Instead, in the early morning hours of Sept. 13, 2008, Ike bent north and hit Galveston dead on, which shifted the most damaging winds east. The sparsely populated Bolivar Peninsula was flattened, but Houston came out O.K.. Still, Ike killed nearly 50 people in Texas alone, left thousands homeless, and was the third costliest hurricane in American history. It would have been the ideal moment for Texas to ask Congress to fund a comprehensive coastal protection system. But on that Monday, Sept. 15, Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in United States history, and the next day the Federal Reserve stepped in to save the failing insurance behemoth A.I.G. with an $85 billion bailout. Nature’s fury took a back seat to the crisis of capital.. . . . . Advertisement. . . . . Continue reading the main story. . . . . Since then, two main research teams have led the way in preparing for the next big storm: Bill Merrell’s “Ike Dike” team at Texas A&M Galveston, and the Sspeed Center at Rice University, led by Phil Bedient and Jim Blackburn.. Dr. Merrell’s Ike Dike has the blessing of simplicity, which softens the sticker shock: It is estimated to cost between $6 billion and $13 billion. The plan is to build a 55-mile-long “coastal spine” along the gulf. The plan’s main disadvantage is that a strong enough hurricane could still flood the Houston Ship Channel, because of what Dr. Bedient calls the “Lake Okeechobee effect.”. “The Okeechobee hurricane came into Florida in 1928 and sloshed water to a 20-foot surge,” Dr. Bedient explained. “Killed 2,000 people. But Lake Okeechobee is unconnected to the coast. It was just wind. Galveston Bay has the same dimensions and depth as Lake Okeechobee in Florida. So imagine we block off Galveston Bay with a coastal spine, and we have a Lake Okeechobee.”. Dr. Bedient worked on the Murphy’s Oil spill in St. Bernard Parish, La., where flooding from Hurricane Katrina ruptured a storage tank, releasing more than a million gallons of oil and ruined approximately 1,800 homes. One of Dr. Bedient’s biggest worries is what a storm might do to the estimated 4,500 similar tanks surrounding Houston, many of them along the ship channel. If even 2 percent of those tanks were to fail because of storm surge, the results would be catastrophic.. The Sspeed Center advocates a layered defense, including a mid-bay gate that could be closed during a storm to protect the channel. On its face, the plan seems unwieldy, but Sspeed’s models show it could stop most of the surge from going up the ship channel, with or without the Ike Dike, at an estimated cost of only a few billion dollars.. In April, Dr. Bedient and Dr. Merrell met with other organizations, lobbyists and government officials to testify before the State of Texas Joint Interim Committee on Coastal Barrier Systems. The session was inconclusive but hopeful: Despite the fact that no clear path was laid out for deciding on a project or funding it, the political will to do . something.  was palpable. The problem is that political will might not be enough.. According to Mr. Blackburn, “Even a locally funded project would probably be three years in the permitting and another six to eight years in construction.” But most local politicians seemed to prefer the Ike Dike, necessarily a federal project. “I have heard more than one person say our plan is to wait until the next hurricane comes,” Mr. Blackburn said, “then depend on guilt money from Washington to fix the problem.”. Dr. Merrell said much the same: “We see local politicians in general content with doing nothing. The do-nothing option is pretty gruesome. It gets you a storm, sooner or later, that’s going to kill thousands of people and cause at least $100 billion in damage.”. . . . . Advertisement. . . . . Continue reading the main story. . . . . We’ve known that climate change was a threat since at least 1988, and the United States has done almost nothing to stop it. Today it might be too late. The feedback mechanisms that scientists have warned us about are happening. Our world is changing.. Imagine we’ve got 20 or 30 years before things really get bad. Imagine how that happens. Imagine FEMA trailers and martial law, toxic waste and flooded hospitals. Imagine politics in a world on fire.. Climate change is hard to think about not only because it’s complex and politically contentious, not only because it’s cognitively almost impossible to keep in mind the intricate relationships that tie together an oil well in Venezuela, Siberian permafrost, Saudi F-15s bombing a Yemeni wedding, subsidence along the Jersey Shore, albedo effect near Kangerlussuaq, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the polar vortex, shampoo, California cattle, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, leukemia, plastic, paper, the Sixth Extinction, Zika, and the basic decisions we make every day, are forced to make every day, in a world we didn’t choose but were thrown into. No, it’s not just because it’s mind-bendingly difficult to connect the dots. Climate change is hard to think about because it’s depressing and scary.. . . Newsletter Sign Up. . .

Thinking seriously about climate change forces us to face the fact that nobody’s driving the car, nobody’s in charge, nobody knows how to “fix it.” And even if we had a driver, there’s a bigger problem: no car. There’s no mechanism for uniting the entire human species to move together in one direction.. There are more than seven billion humans, and we divide into almost 200 countries, thousands of smaller sub-national states, territories, counties and municipalities, and an unimaginable multitude of corporations, community organizations, neighborhoods, religious sects, ethnic identities, clans, tribes, gangs, clubs and families, each of which faces its own disunion and strife, all the way down to the individual human soul in conflict with itself, torn between fear and desire, hard sacrifice and easy cruelty, all of us improvising day by day, moment to moment, making decisions based on best guesses, hunches, comforting illusions and too little data.. But that’s the human way: reactive, ad hoc, improvised. Our ability to reconfigure our collective existence in response to changing environmental conditions has been our greatest adaptive trait. Unfortunately for us, we’re still not very good at controlling the future. What we’re good at is telling ourselves the stories we want to hear, the stories that help us cope with existence in an wild, unpredictable world.. . . . .  Correction: October 16, 2016 .  . . . An opinion article last Sunday about how a major hurricane could affect the petrochemical industry in Texas described incorrectly one possible effect. A hurricane could produce spills of natural gas liquids; it would not cause spilling of liquefied natural gas, which would be released into the air instead. The essay also misstated a distinction held by the Port of Houston. It is a major shipping point for natural gas liquids, not for liquefied natural gas..  . . . . . . . . .

A satellite image of Hurricane Harvey on Friday morning. (NOAA/NASA).  .  . We will continue to update this story as new questions come in..  . By all predictions, . Hurricane Harvey.  will be a historic storm for Southeast Texas. Multiple feet of rain, as much as 12 feet of storm surge and up to 120 mph winds are among the list of impacts. Thousands of customers will be without power for days, well inland from the coast..  . We’ve received hundreds of questions about the severity of this storm and its impacts. Here are your questions, answered:.  . How long will this last?.  . Hurricane Harvey is not your average hurricane. It’s going to last multiple days. There are some projections that make us think the storm could still be over Southeast Texas on Tuesday or Wednesday. People in this region should be prepared for at least three days of terrible weather..  .  .  .  .  .  . Capital Weather Gang's Angela Fritz explains why Harvey will have an effect for days after making landfall on the Texas coast. (Claritza Jimenez,Angela Fritz/The Washington Post).  .  .  .  .  .  [. Hurricane Harvey bears down on Texas coast with ‘catastrophic’ flooding expected. ] .  .  . How much rain is expected and what will be its impact?.  . As much as 2-3 FEET of rain, although we don’t know exactly where the highest totals will end up falling. Southeast Texas from Corpus Christi to Houston is at risk of major flash flooding and river flooding, including areas that are five to six counties inland..  . When will the storm be the worst?.  . Unfortunately there’s no point in time where we can say “this is the worst the storm will get.” Your worst impacts will depend on your location. This is also going to last a long time — several days — and it’s possible things could get better and then worse again..  . For this reason, we’re encouraging everyone who can to evacuate the area before conditions deteriorate..  . What does it mean that Harvey will be a Category 3 hurricane?.  . Category 3 is right in the middle of the Saffir Simpson Scale, which runs from 1 to 5. But that doesn’t mean it’s just a “moderate” hurricane. Once it hits Cat 3, . we start calling it a “major hurricane”.  because that’s the point at which . DEVASTATING damage will occur. :.  . Well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes..  .  .  [. From space, ‘astounding’ Hurricane Harvey looks like it’s about to swallow all of Texas. ] .  .  . Storm surge — how many feet expected, and why are these so dangerous?.  . Up to 12 feet of storm surge is expected. The largest surge will happen to the right of the center of the storm..  . Storm surge is ocean water that’s pushed onto land by hurricane wind. In a sense, it is simply a very big flood. When forecasts say storm surge could reach 12 feet, it means water in those locations could climb to 12 feet above normally dry land, or the height of two tall men stacked on top of one another..  . What is the timing and area of landfall?.  . Harvey is already starting to impact the coastal areas with rain. Landfall will happen Friday night into Saturday morning, but landfall won’t matter too much in this storm since it’s going to linger in the same area for so long..  . Is it true that the storm could make a second landfall?.  . Yes, there are some indications that the storm’s center may drift back out over the Gulf, potentially restrengthen, and then come ashore again. In any case, the message is the same: a long-duration flood, surge and wind event..  . Why will this last for so many days?.  . Harvey is going to stall simply because there will be nothing in the atmosphere to push it away. Hurricanes need the jet stream to come through and push it out.

Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city, could receive 20 inches or more of rain from the storm, depending on exactly where it tracks — with the heaviest moving in Saturday or Sunday and then continuing into early next week. Matt Lanza, a meteorologist based in Houston, said 20 inches would be “devastating” for the city, depending where it fell. A worst-case scenario, Lanza said, would be for this amount of rain to fall just northwest of downtown as “all that water has to push through the bayou networks across the city into Galveston Bay.”.  .  .

Both of these factors have significant implications for where the heaviest rain falls and how long the deluge persists..  . Right now, it is important for Texans in the path of this storm to understand — irrespective of where the storm makes landfall — Harvey’s footprint will be enormous because of the large expanse of its heavy rain field and long duration. Preparations should be brought to completion hastily..  . A note about what is considered a major hurricane.  . A major hurricane is technically defined as one rated Category 3 or higher on the 1-5 Saffir-Simpson intensity scale. The last major hurricane to make landfall on the United States was Wilma in October 2005. While Hurricane Ike in 2008 produced a devastating storm surge around Galveston and a massive economic toll, it was rated a high-end Category 2 storm at landfall. Superstorm Sandy, another devastating weather event, was no longer officially considered a hurricane when it made landfall near Atlantic City in 2012.

As such, a hurricane watch has been issued from just north of Port Mansfield to San Luis Pass. This means that hurricane conditions are possible within about 48 hours.. . . Harvey is currently in the organizing stage and is beginning to slowly take on a more classic tropical storm look. The NHC says that it will likely be a slow process at first followed by the potential for a “quickly strengthening cyclone” as it approaches the Texas coast Friday.. . .

An Air Force plane, recon as we call it, confirmed the wind speed and so now we do indeed have a tropical storm once again.. . . A lot is going on with this storm and we are still not much closer to any definitive answers as to what the final track/intensity will be. Furthermore, the track AFTER Harvey makes landfall is also up for debate and carries a heavy load in terms of impacts to huge metro areas such as Houston.. . . Equally as important but for different reasons, the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) is also at risk of seeing extreme rain over the next several days which has implications on farming and impacting a different segment of the population.. . . I am currently in Houston, TX preparing for what’s next with Harvey. I have plenty of equipment with me which can be set up to document and stream live what ever impacts head this way. I do not know yet how far south I will need to travel – perhaps Corpus Christi, perhaps South Padre and vicinity.
